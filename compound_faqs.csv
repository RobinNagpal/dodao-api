It's important to note that the cToken balance increases automatically over time for the holder due to interest accrual. If you are working with the new wrapper contract, it provides a static balance of the underlying asset as well, which eliminates the need for additional calculations.",,,1,https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/402912055448961034/1164474066544103455

This issue appears while withdrawing through contract interaction. What could be causing this error??","The error you're encountering when trying to withdraw through contract interaction is likely due to the incorrect usage of the withdraw function. When using the withdraw function in Compound V3, you should pass the address of the USDC token and the amount you want to withdraw, rather than the cToken (or Comet) address. This is because cUSDC (or cTokens in general) is a representation of the underlying asset, and you should specify the USDC token address when calling the withdraw function. The amount you provide should be in USDC, as USDC:cUSDC maintains a 1:1 conversion ratio. This way, you'll be able to withdraw the correct amount in USDC.",,,1,https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/402912055448961034/1164786690246840340
