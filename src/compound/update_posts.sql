UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound governance has been active recently with several proposals and discussions taking place. The main news is the announcement of Compound III, which allows borrowing of USDC using various collateral assets. However, there were some issues with the Oracle upgrade, causing temporary freezing of the cETH market. Two proposals were made to address this issue, one to revert the Oracle back to v2 and another to pause liquidations until the price feed is restored. Other proposals include risk parameter updates, setting borrow caps, and initiating COMP distribution for Compound III users. Gauntlet is seeking community feedback through Snapshot votes on reserve factors and collateral factors. In the forums, there are discussions on delegate platforms, renewing Gauntlet's engagement, and moving the governance forum. On Twitter, Compound Grants 2.0 is looking for Domain Allocators and Gauntlet presents its Compound case-study. The governance-feed channel in Discord tracks proposal votes and stages. In the developer community calls, there are discussions on various topics related to governance.
Last week's governance recap from Boardroom covered important governance-related content. Proposals included increasing supply caps for WBTC, ETH, and COMP in Compound III, adjusting the OpenZeppelin security partnership for Q4, and renewing the Gauntlet <> Compound partnership. In the forums, discussions included updates from OpenZeppelin on security, suggestions to update cComp parameters, proposals for a Dune dashboard and educational materials for Compound III, and discussions on normalizing the ETH market and deprecating the FEI market. The developer community call featured discussions led by Gauntlet, OpenZeppelin, and the TUSD team. This week, a proposal to increase supply caps in Compound III did not reach quorum, the OpenZeppelin security partnership adjustment for Q4 passed, and discussions in the forums included risk parameter updates and proposals to deprecate the FEI market and add new markets. It was noted that reaching quorum has been a challenge lately and there were discussions on Twitter and Discord about voting and deploying the new implementation of cUSDCv3. The next developer community call is scheduled for October 5. This week, proposals included risk parameter changes for FEI and a proposal to improve governance discussion and voting processes with Commonwealth. Discussions in the forums included updates on the Compound Grants Program, proposals to update cCOMP parameters and improve liquidation event handling in Compound III. Flashstake also announced an opportunity to earn Compound lending fees. The next developer community call is scheduled for October 19.
Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs) are being discussed and implemented to enhance the Compound Protocol. One proposal aims to pause the supply for certain assets to mitigate potential attacks. Another proposal suggests adjusting parameters for cCOMP and cUNI markets. Additionally, there are discussions about creating a new governance structure for Compound. In the developer community calls, topics such as credit models in DeFi and establishing rules for crypto are being discussed. The next community call is scheduled for November 2. CIP-1 is currently in the final call stage before going to Snapshot for voting. The market downturn has been analyzed, and risk parameter updates are being recommended based on market volatility. The SUSHI supplier's credit score is being evaluated, and there are discussions about enabling SUSHI in Compound III. Overall, governance in DeFi is an active and important area of focus.
Compound has had several discussions and actions related to risk, including passing proposals and making updates. The Compound Grants 2.0 program is moving forward, and there have been discussions about protocol maintenance and risk parameters. OpenZeppelin has proposed renewing their security partnership with Compound, and there have been discussions about upgrading the oracle and increasing supply caps.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$TrustToken, the team behind TrueUSD, is proposing to list TrueUSD on Compound. They believe that TrueUSD would be a valuable addition to Compound due to its reliable live price feeds, strong community interest, and sufficient market liquidity. They also mention that other TrueCurrencies, such as TCAD, TAUD, TGBP, and THKD, could also add value to the Compound platform in the future. TrueUSD has been listed on AAVE since 2019 and currently ranks 3rd in market size among stablecoins on AAVE. It is the only stablecoin with live attestations to corroborate its reserves. TrueUSD has the highest trust rating among fiat-backed stablecoins on AAVE. It has over $280M in market cap and enjoys deep liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The MakerDAO community has accepted TrueUSD as collateral and is considering accepting other TrueCurrencies as well. TrueUSD is widely available through fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, providing a new entry point for Compound users. TrustToken commits to providing $1mm of liquidity for each stablecoin they onboard to Compound. They are open to addressing any questions or concerns from the Compound community.
Compound, a platform for lending and borrowing crypto, has limited demand for most of its assets. Just two stablecoins make up 93% of Compound's total borrow and 69% of its total supply. This suggests that stablecoins are the most popular assets for lending and borrowing. AAVE, another lending platform, also has 92% of its total borrow from stablecoins. TrueCurrencies, a stablecoin issuer, believes that listing their stablecoins on Compound would benefit both platforms. TrueCurrencies offers highly trustworthy stablecoins with 24/7 live audits and plans to report collateralization on-chain. Listing TrueCurrencies on Compound would increase liquidity and total value locked (TVL) on the platform. It would also provide more options for borrowers and diversify Compound's collateral types. The data suggests that stablecoins are in high demand for lending and borrowing, and TrueCurrencies aims to meet that demand.
The Compound community is considering listing TUSD and is looking at factors such as Uniswap liquidity. TUSD has over $920k liquidity on Uniswap. TUSD has been added to MakerDAO and has become the 4th most demanded collateral type. The community believes TUSD would see similar high demand on Compound. They have submitted a proposal to list TUSD and are seeking support. There are questions about trading TUSD, but alternatives like 1inch can be used. The COMP Distribution and Collateral Factor for TUSD can be adjusted by the community after it has launched.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/trueusd-listing-proposal/219$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Aera is a solution for optimizing DAO funds autonomously and on-chain. It provides a non-custodial solution for managing treasury funds efficiently and transparently. Aera vaults are automatically rebalanced by Vault Guardians to meet the desired portfolio strategy. Aera has been audited and tested internally for 9 months and has launched a pilot with Moonwell. Compound is considering a pilot with Aera to optimize its reserves. The pilot would involve depositing BAT or 0x into an Aera Vault on mainnet and continuously rebalancing the vault based on market conditions. The vault's performance can be viewed through a public dashboard. Aera is interested in developing yield-bearing vaults in the future.
Aera is interested in developing yield-bearing vaults to help Compound capture compound yield without incurring principal risk. They have added support for staking yields on ETH and generating yield in ERC4626-compatible pools. However, there are concerns about trading strategies during high-volatility regimes and the use of volatility as a target for rebalancing. Aera uses an execution strategy that minimizes slippage and utilizes strong liquidity sources. They also use exponential moving averages to smooth volatility and only rebalance based on smaller changes in volatility. There are discussions about the risks involved in providing liquidity on GMX and the defense mechanisms against inflation attacks. Aera's GitHub can be found at aera-finance/aera-contracts-public.
The proposed design for the AERA pilot using historical volatility or its EMA as the target for rebalancing is underwhelming. Better targets that take into account forecasted price moves should be considered. The pilot may not effectively demonstrate the potential strengths and benefits of AERA. The current proposal's volatility targeting objective is not meant to predict future prices but rather maintain a constant ETH exposure as measured by risk. The pilot is seen as a good showcase of AERA's initial capabilities with limited downside. The selected assets and their conversion to wstETH and USDC are seen as positive. It is suggested to substitute USDC for sDAI. It is debated whether it makes sense to supply assets to Compound or a competitor. Speculating with reserves money is not in the interest of the protocol.
The Aera pilot proposal aims to convert minor assets reserves from v2 pools into something more solid. This will allow reserves to stay reserves regardless of the direction and scale of movement in crypto markets. The proposal suggests targeting a portfolio with a specific volatility as a balanced approach to treasury/reserves management. After a trial period, the DAO can assess the efficacy of this strategy and potentially propose new objectives. The custody of funds remains entirely under Compound DAO's discretion, and the pilot's duration can be increased if needed. Aera emerges as a promising non-custodial solution for DAO fund management. The proposal accepts ownership of the vault, asset registry, and hooks module, removes ZRX and BAT from V2 reserves, deposits into the Compound Aera vault, and resumes the Aera vault for rebalancing. The Compound Governance page may have errors, but voting can be done using Tally or Boardroom. The vote has passed and been executed.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$This proposal aims to adjust parameters for the Compound ETH market. It includes implementing a borrow cap and updating the interest rate model to a new jump rate model. The motivation behind these changes is the upcoming Ethereum merge upgrade and potential forks, which could increase liquidity risk for cETH. The proposed changes will penalize excessive utilization and borrowing in the cETH market to reduce risk and maintain orderly liquidation mechanisms. The new interest rate model includes higher borrowing rates to incentivize liquidity in light of potential fork windfalls. A relatively low borrow cap is proposed to provide additional protection against excessive utilization. The impact on current users would be an increase in borrowing and supply rates. If adopted, a one-time payment of 100 COMP will be transferred to compensate for research and development costs. Future changes are planned after the merge is completed. This proposal is provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.
The author acknowledges the need to update the ETH interest rate model before the merge but expresses concerns about the proposed model being too punitive. They suggest alternative parameters that could potentially improve the model. They also discuss the timing of the switch and suggest involving the community in the decision-making process. The author presents an alternative rate model that aims to protect against dangerous utilization levels while still allowing for economically viable borrowing. They also mention the need to adjust the rate models to account for changes in block times. Another participant expresses doubts about the need for immediate action and believes that utilization levels will not reach problematic levels. However, another participant argues that without action, there could be a prolonged period of unsafe utilization. They discuss the economic incentives for users to borrow ETH and the potential risks involved. The participants also discuss the compatibility of the new interest rate model with cETH and the possibility of implementing borrow caps. They mention the need to revert back to normal parameters after the merge and discuss the usage of reserves to support users who want to withdraw ETH under 100% utilization. Overall, there are different opinions and suggestions regarding the interest rate model and the potential risks associated with utilization levels.
The proposal suggests updating the interest rate model for ETH on Compound. The new model would accelerate the interest rate if the pool utilization exceeds a certain threshold called the Kink. The effectiveness of this change depends on factors such as the expected yield of fork farming and the duration of ETH borrowing. The analysis shows that raising the interest rate can reduce the profitability of fork farming and decrease the time of 100% pool utilization. However, it also makes the market more unpredictable. The conclusion is that while upgrading the interest rate model is supported, setting a low borrow cap for the cETH market is more effective in minimizing ETH illiquidity. The proposal also mentions that OpenZeppelin has reviewed the technical aspects and confirms that the interest rate model can be replaced. The community's comments and feedback are appreciated.
The proposal suggests setting a borrow cap of 100,000 ETH to ensure the stability of the protocol during the merge. However, some argue that a higher cap of 200-250k ETH would be more reasonable. The focus should be on collateralized borrowers rather than ETH yield seekers. The borrow cap guardian could potentially raise the cap if liquidity risk is lower than expected. The core concept of decentralized protocols is to provide permissionless and available service, so restricting it based on governance decisions may set a bad precedent.
The proposal aims to make changes to the cETH market on Compound v2 in preparation for the Ethereum merge and switch to POS consensus. This includes setting a borrow cap of 100,000 ETH and updating the interest rate model. The changes are intended to mitigate the risk of excessive borrowing and potential disruption to ETH lending markets during the merge. The proposal also includes payments to contributors for their analysis and development work.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-adjust-eth-interest-rate-model/3493$$;

The current imbalance in the COMP market is due to the existing Borrowing CAP, which was expected to be raised but was not. Once the cap is adjusted, the market will likely come back into balance. The community multisig has not taken any action to address this issue. One possible solution to fix the imbalance is to lower COMP distribution for the COMP market. However, there is no significant reason to touch the COMP distribution, as it was set where it is now to provide additional rewards for COMP holders. The cCOMP market does not have a strong use case for borrowing at the moment, and there are ideas in development to address this. Raising the borrow cap will not solve the problem, as it will still allow individuals to game the system and the COMP distribution will foot the bill. Lowering COMP speeds on cCOMP can help stop this manipulation. Overall, a new interest rate model and alternative structure for COMP staking are needed to fix the current situation.
The suggestion is to use some of the money saved to fund and speed up community development. The discussion also includes topics such as borrowing COMP, the distribution of COMP, and the idea of introducing a grants committee. There is a proposal to raise the borrow cap instead of reducing COMP distribution. The idea of incentivizing cCOMP and allowing COMP holders to use it as collateral is also discussed. Another concept is introduced, which involves creating a cCOMP2 market without borrowing and allowing vote delegation.
The proposal suggests adjusting COMP speeds and introducing a cCOMP2 market with zero borrowing. Some users argue that incentivizing cCOMP holders goes against the COMP agenda, while others believe that COMP lacks economic incentives. One user suggests increasing the borrow cap on COMP, while another proposes a solution for setting market utilization based on the borrow cap. The discussion also mentions a previous proposal for enabling borrow caps.

The proposal includes imposing a 10% penalty on the sent funds and returning them only to the address they were sent from. The sender must request their funds back with a signed signature or on-chain transaction verifying their identity. The minimum value for return is $1,000. The proposal also includes a new function in the CErc20 smart contract to sweep tokens to the admin. The changes have been reviewed and tested, and a proposal has been created to implement them. There is discussion about the process and potential unintended consequences. The PR for the implementation is final and matches the deployed code. The implementation has been tested on testnet and simulations show it will work as expected. There is also discussion about the 10% penalty and the allocation of COMP rewards. The proposal is now live and there is clarification on where the penalty funds will go. There are limitations on which contracts can recover accidentally sent tokens.
The user is asking if a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is recoverable. The response states that the transaction is not recoverable and explains the limitations of a decentralized blockchain. In another scenario, a user accidentally sent funds to a wrong address and asks if it can be transferred back. The response states that the funds can be recovered through a proposal. In a third scenario, a user mistakenly sent WBTC to the Compound controller and asks how to retrieve it. The response advises the user to follow the directions provided to recover the funds.
The user swapped $6k cCOMP for dust COMP using ZeroEx on Uniswap. This happened because they used a Uniswap pool with low liquidity, causing significant slippage. Someone else later equalized the pool. The user asks for recommendations for alternative platforms and if Compound Labs offers support, but the response states that Compound Labs cannot help. The user also mentions a proposal to return the funds, which includes code from PR #193. The exact amounts of tokens sent to the comptroller are provided, along with information about a transaction sweeping the cUNI. The user claims that their 400 uni was sent to the Compound Deployer address and requests their balance to reflect on their wallet address.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The USDC market has been live for over 2 months and has undergone 4 governance proposals. It currently has $91.33M of collateral assets, $45.33M of USDC borrowed, and $88.86M of USDC supplied. A second market on Ethereum Mainnet is being proposed, utilizing WETH as the base asset. The proposal suggests initializing the market with 2 collateral assets: wstETH and cbETH. The ChainLink ETH/USD price feed will be used for the base asset, and a custom wrapper around the ChainLink stETH/USD feed will be used for wstETH. Coinbase has launched a new cbETH/USD price feed. The contracts will be deployed once input on parameters is received and audit feedback is received from OpenZeppelin. A proposal to migrate remaining rewards from v2 to cWETHv3 and cUSDCv3 is also suggested. Gauntlet will provide risk analysis for the community. The community is discussing how to encourage wETH supply in the Comet market, including options such as configuring the interest rate curve differently, pausing supplying of ETH on V2, and distributing COMP incentives on Comet.
Gauntlet recommends the following interest rate curves for the WETH Comet in Compound III:
- For WETH borrowing:
  - 0% utilization: 1% APR
  - 90% utilization: 5.2% APR (matching stETH stake rate)
  - 100% utilization: 10.4% APR (double stETH stake rate)
  - Linear in between
- For WETH supply:
  - 0% utilization: 0% APR + COMP incentive
  - 90% utilization: 1.7% APR + COMP incentive
  - 100% utilization: 7.8% APR + COMP incentive
  - Linear in between

The specific parameters for the interest rate curves are as follows:
- Borrow kink: 900000000000000000
- Borrow per second interest rate base: 315360530
- Borrow per second interest rate slope high: 16398720000
- Borrow per second interest rate slope low: 1639871893
- Supply kink: 900000000000000000
- Supply per second interest rate base: 0
- Supply per second interest rate slope high: 19236960000
- Supply per second interest rate slope low: 536111569

These recommendations are based on the assumption that stETH has an annualized yield of approximately 5%, the current utilization statistics of the Compound II ETH market, and the use case of the WETH Comet. The WETH borrowed cannot be used as collateral, reducing market risk and the need for high interest rates.
The user is asking about the USDC interest rates and the reserve factor in Compound III. They are questioning why the USDC supply interest rate is higher than the borrow interest rate at 100% utilization and if the goal is to increase the Compound DAO reserve through COMP distribution. Another user suggests adjusting the interest rate curves to maintain positive reserve factors. The response explains that the interest rate model generates reserves above 50% utilization and decreases reserves below 50% utilization. They also mention that the supply interest rate needs to be higher to incentivize users to supply wETH. The response provides two options for adjusting the interest rate curves and discusses the tradeoffs. The response also mentions the need for more data on the ETH reserves in order to fine-tune the recommendations. The response includes the recommended parameters for deploying cWETHv3 and the price feeds used. It also mentions the completion of an additional audit and provides the contract addresses for the cWETHv3 market and the proxy contract. The response explains the initialization proposal for the market, including migrating COMP distribution, configuring the Comet instance, and seeding the market with reserves. The deployment and proposal migrations were done using the Comet scenario framework and the Comet deployment manager.
The initial risk parameters for wstETH and cbETH follow Gauntlet's recommendations. However, there is a question about Gauntlet's denomination in $USD and whether it would be more accurate to denominate the supply caps in ETH. The liquidity for cbETH has improved since the initial recommendation, and there is now less slippage on swaps. The governance cycle is considered too long, and there is a proposal to automate the process. The supply caps for wstETH and cbETH were originally suggested in $USD terms, but there is a meaningful difference in ETH terms. The borrow and supply statistics for cbETH show the total borrow and supply amounts for different addresses. The total amount of WETH borrowed is 5814, and the total amount of cbETH supplied is 6458.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/initialize-compound-iii-weth-on-ethereum/3737$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$A proposal is being made to improve the security of the Compound platform and its dApps by offering formal verification and path coverage tools. This proposal is separate from the Open Zeppelin proposal and suggests writing formal correctness rules for the Compound Protocol. The Certora Prover tool has been successful in preventing bugs and vulnerabilities in other DeFi protocols. Certora has a history of working with the Compound team and has already found critical issues in the Comet protocol. The proposal aims to provide access to the community and educate them on formal specifications and code review. Recent exploits have shown the need for improved security measures. Applying Certora Prover to check Proposal 62 could have identified the bug that caused significant financial losses.
The proposal suggests two approaches to increase confidence in the platform and smart contracts built on it. The first approach is the Certora Prover, which proves the soundness of critical parts of the code and detects hard-to-find bugs. The second approach is a symbolic execution tool for path coverage, which continuously increases coverage for complex specifications. The proposal also includes formally specifying high-level rules in CVL, an open-source language, and compensating non-Certora rule writers with COMP tokens. The Certora Prover will be integrated into VSCode and provide ongoing status of proven or violated rules. Additionally, a code coverage tool will be developed to generate inputs and check contract compliance. Success will be measured by the number of paths covered, rules proved, bugs identified by the Certora Prover and path coverage tool, and missed bugs found by auditors. Certora also offers services such as an online course, Zoom calls, access to the Kotlin code repository, and a dashboard displaying path coverage results.
Certora is proposing to create an open-source database of CVL rules and code to decentralize rule writing and promote decentralized contributions to rules. The annual price for this service is $2,000,000, with $1,000,000 paid in USDC and $1,000,000 paid in COMP tokens. An additional $400,000 in COMP will be used to pay decentralized community rule writers. Certora will help write rules, teach the community how to write rules, and run the rules on their servers. They will also make their source code available to the community. Continuous formal verification is seen as a step towards more efficient governance and can help prevent security breaches. Gauntlet is supportive of Certora's proposal. Certora's rules match an interface and can be executed on any implementation of the interface. Certora plans to extend their rules to cover more properties of listed assets and write ERC20 properties specific to Compound's system. The Certora Prover is a bug-finding tool that can help identify vulnerabilities in contracts. Audits and bug bounties are also useful in the DeFi security toolkit. OpenZeppelin is using Certora to formally verify their governance contract. Formal verification is seen as a component of an overall holistic security process that includes other security measures. The decision on pricing and vendor selection is left up to the Compound community.
OpenZeppelin believes that having robust formal verification (FV) rules would enhance the security of governance proposals in Compound. However, they clarify that FV rules should be written separately from the code and audited separately from their security audits. OpenZeppelin also clarifies that Certora's code coverage tool is different from Forta Network, as Certora's tool is used for evaluating code prior to deployment while Forta is used to monitor live smart contract events after deployment. They also mention the importance of clearly defining the security decision-making responsibilities. Overall, OpenZeppelin's feedback is neutral and they leave it to Certora and the community to decide how to proceed.
OpenZeppelin should take responsibility for any major security issues found by Certora's FV service. However, it is unlikely to happen as OpenZeppelin has done a good job and Certora has not found major issues after their audit. Compound should consider buying all security services and audits to maximize security. While costs are high, formal verification should not be sacrificed.

The Compound team uses various techniques for testing and auditing code changes, including formal verification with Certora. Certora has developed a unique language and tool for verifying smart contracts. They have been working with Compound since its inception and have identified critical issues in the protocol. They propose granting access to the Certora Prover to the Compound community, allocating a team of security engineers for code review, and creating a community of security researchers. Certora will provide services such as an online course, office hours, and a tool for converting rules. They will also engage with other security firms and create a mirror git repository for the Prover's source code. The proposed price for the project is $1.5M per annum, with payment in USD/USDC and COMP tokens. The regular price for the Prover and professional services would be $2.96M, but Certora is offering a discount of $1.46M.
Certora is proposing a formal verification service for Compound to enhance the security of the protocol. They believe that the cost of potential hacks or failures could be worse than the cost of extra security. Certora will provide a team of security engineers to review code changes and provide formal security rules. They will also integrate their Certora Prover tool into Compound's development pipeline. Certora is committed to the project's well-being and is accepting 1/3 of the price in COMP, locking it for one year. They are also developing open-source technology that can be used independently. The cost of the proposal is $750k for 6 months, with termination available through governance voting. Certora will allocate $100k to incentivize independent security researchers.
Aave does not support the proposed increase in expenditure due to security concerns. The bug in question was not found until it was exploited, despite multiple rounds of auditing and formal verification. Euler Finance was hacked for $177M USD, and the bug was added after a Certora report from October 31, 2021. The commit in question adds functionality to prevent governance from drawing down reserves below the initial level and allows users to donate dust to the reserves. The newly added functionality was not reviewed by the Certora team. Omniscia offers auditing services and has audited numerous projects. The Compound III codebase is already formally verified, and this proposal does not demonstrate a clear path for how developers will use Certora.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound has been working with Chainlink to develop the UniswapAnchorView (UAV) V3. The new version uses Uniswap V3 Oracles and has an increased number of markets available. The shift to V3 is important because V2 liquidity is decreasing. The code for UAV V3 can be found on the Github page. The new version no longer records observations but queries the Uniswap V3 pool's observe function to get a TWAP. The math for conversion between prices and TWAP has been modified. The tests have been adapted to the new architecture and Hardhat has been implemented. The protocol supports various coins and the TVL of the anchor market. The change from V2 to V3 is positive overall, but there are some markets where it is less positive. It is important to have sufficient liquidity to prevent price manipulation. The failover has never been activated and there haven't been any issues with the price feeds. Aggregating prices across multiple DEXs would be best to ensure sufficient liquidity.
The UniswapAnchoredView (UAV) V3 has been successfully deployed, replacing the previous version that used Uniswap V2 pools. The new UAV queries the Uniswap V3 pool's observe function to get a TWAP when needed. The price of an asset in Uniswap V3 is determined by the ""tick"" of the pool. The tests from the original UAV have been adapted to the new architecture, and Hardhat has been implemented for real Uniswap V3 pools in tests. The Uniswap observation cardinality has been increased to 150 for pools that were below that number. The liquidity levels of various Uniswap V3 pools are listed, and it is noted that low liquidity in these pools may affect the accuracy of the TWAP price. The next steps include the Compound community signaling support for the upgrade and configuring validator proxies to push prices to the new UAV candidate. If the vote is passed, the Comptroller will point to UAV V3 and decommission UAV V2.
Compound Labs and OpenZeppelin are working to resolve a price feed issue in the cETH market. A new governance proposal has been submitted to revert the upgrade and return to using the V2 Oracle contract. The issue is causing withdrawals and liquidations in the cETH market to be frozen. However, no funds are at risk and the rest of the cToken markets on Compound V2 and V3 are functional. Users who deposited ETH and obtained cETH for opening borrow positions may be at risk of instant liquidation if the price of ETH drops significantly before the fix proposal executes. Users can monitor their borrow positions and add collateral or repay borrowed assets to mitigate this risk. Downstream protocols may also be affected, and there may be a need to pause liquidations to allow these protocols to adjust their positions. OpenZeppelin has prepared a proposal to unpause liquidations if necessary. The pause, if implemented, will last for approximately 23 hours. The community will be updated on the progress, and a post-mortem will be conducted after the fix is finalized. Only Index Coop is currently identified as a protocol at risk.

CGP 2.0 went live in January 2023 with a grants budget of $800k spread across four domains. Over the past two quarters, CGP 2.0 domain allocators approved proposals requesting $670,000 in grants and disbursed $252,000 to accepted proposals. The program has received exceptional feedback from the builder community, with an NPS score of 8.6/10 and an experience score of 8.2/10. The acceptance rate for proposals is 40%, indicating high-quality submissions. The grants team has maintained a communication turnaround time of less than 48 hours and a funding turnaround time of less than 2 weeks. The milestone completion rate for funded proposals is ~57%. The renewed program aims to address challenges and improve operational efficiency. The proposal suggests a budget of $970k for two quarters, with allocations for Dapps and New Protocol Ideas, Multi-Chain/Cross-Chain Strategy and Dev Tooling, and Security Tooling domains. The Dapps and New Protocol Ideas domain will receive a higher budget of $450,000, while the Security Tooling domain will receive $150,000. The program will continue to use the Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model.

It also discusses compensation for the grants committee members and the use of external services. The funding overview of CGP 2.0 is provided, along with the allocation of funds for milestone payouts and committee compensation. KPIs and expectations for the program are listed, as well as the roles and responsibilities of domain allocators. Questbook is introduced as the decentralized grant orchestration tool and the Program Manager. The next steps include community feedback and voting on the proposal.
The content discusses feedback and support for the CGP 2.0 grant program. Grantees express gratitude for the smooth process and provide positive feedback on the program. There is a proposal to adjust the budget for certain domains based on the number of proposals received. The importance of incorporating feedback from proposers and grantees is emphasized, and plans to gather feedback more frequently and organize interactive sessions are mentioned. There is also a suggestion to allow more time for the community to assess the impact of CGP 2.0 before starting CGP 3.0. The value of using Request for Proposals (RFPs) is highlighted, and concerns are raised about the current inbound approach. Some funded projects are questioned for their value and redundancy.
The Compound Grants Program (CGP) has faced some challenges and areas for improvement. One issue is that certain projects funded by the program do not provide significant value to Compound and may even collect fees without benefiting the DAO. Another concern is the lack of a dedicated quality oversight stakeholder, which could potentially harm the protocol's reputation. To address these issues, suggestions for improvement include focusing on a Request for Proposal (RFP) model, designating OpenZeppelin (OZ) as the quality oversight stakeholder, and tying milestone payouts to value creation. The CGP team is open to feedback and actively working to improve the program.
Compound is implementing changes to improve the evaluation process for grant proposals. They are focusing on selecting proposals that align with Compound's objectives and generate maximum value for the protocol. They are also enhancing community oversight and collaboration with approved proposals to ensure transparency and avoid reputation damage. The responsibilities of domain allocators have been extended to include requesting audits for proposals involving Solidity code. Compound is dedicated to implementing quality assurance measures and is open to further improvements suggested by the community. They acknowledge the need to review pending proposals and are open to collaborating with other entities to support Compound's growth. Overall, the grant application process has been positive, with the Questbook tool being easy to use and the allocation process being transparent.
The author discusses their observations and suggestions for improving the Compound Grants Program (CGP). They mention the hybrid approach of CGP 2.0, which included both inbound proposals and requests for proposals (RFPs). They highlight the value of allowing applications beyond strict RFPs to widen the scope of potential builders and tap into the broader community's ideas. They also discuss the need for better milestone articulation and tying milestones to value creation. The author acknowledges the challenges of attaching timelines to key performance indicators (KPIs) and articulating metrics for certain projects. They mention the difficulty of monitoring TVL or related KPIs and the embodied cost of adding additional development. The author expresses support for elevating OpenZeppelin's role in oversight and disagrees with the suggestion that the CGP director and domain allocators are not incentivized to act in the DAO's best interest. They note the impact of postponing the review of concerns on builders' uncertainty and commitment. The author also mentions the potential for retroactive funding in future iterations of CGP but raises objections to it being a retroactive-first program.
The grants program should be more aligned with the needs of the community to ensure the best ideas are brought forward. The renewal proposal for the program should be discussed further before proceeding. Feedback from the community should be gathered before presenting a refined proposal. Applications that deviate from the program's goals should be rejected, and the program should focus on selective funding. The process of revising milestones and proposals should be improved. Performance-based milestones tied to protocol metrics are preferable, but there are challenges in implementing them. There should be a focus on quality assurance for the work being funded. There may be a misalignment of incentives for domain allocators, and there should be a stringent quality standard for projects approved by the DAO. The postponement of the program renewal is not neutral.
The cancellation of CGP 2.0 has caused uncertainty among builders in the community. The original funds allocated to the grants program should not be affected by these discussions. Some suggestions for improvement include using open calls instead of RFPs to attract new ideas and perspectives, considering alternative metrics to TVL for evaluating protocol success, and involving domain allocators in the grant allocation process. The feedback and input from Compound Labs and the community are crucial for the success of CGP 2.0 renewal. Weekly updates on funded projects will be provided to the community. Unallocated funds from CGP 2.0 have been returned to the Compound treasury.
Compound Grants Program 2.0 (CGP 2.0) is being renewed with a budget of $970,000 spread across three domains. CGP 2.0 has received positive feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators. The program has approved proposals and disbursed funds to accepted projects. The metrics show a high acceptance rate and efficient communication and funding turnaround times. The program aims to address challenges and make improvements, such as ensuring consistent turnaround times, addressing funding discrepancies, and improving operational efficiency. The proposal suggests renewing CGP 2.0 with a budget of $970k for two quarters and supporting specific domains based on community feedback.
The grants budget for the Dapps and New Protocol Ideas domain will be increased to $450,000, while the grants budget for the Security Tooling domain will be reduced to $150,000. The grants program will continue to use a dual-track approach, with both outbound and inbound proposals. The Program Manager will provide updates on proposal status and communicate with the community through forum posts and community calls. The grants program will be run using the Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1, with transparency provided through Questbook. Compensation for the Program Manager and domain allocators will be based on hourly rates. The grants committee will use Questbook for grants orchestration and continue to use Synapse and Docusign for KYC and contractual agreements. The performance of each domain will be evaluated after two quarters. The grants committee members will be fairly compensated for their efforts. The grants committee will focus on KPIs such as user onboarding, TVL, and project activity on Compound. The success of the program will be measured by factors such as proposal completion rates and community involvement. Domain allocators will continue to uphold their responsibilities and may request audits for certain proposals. Questbook will continue as the Program Manager, with Ruchil taking over the role from Sriharsha Karamchati. The community is invited to provide feedback before an on-chain vote.
The renewal proposal for CGP will maintain its dual-track approach, including both inbound and outbound proposals. Updates on accepted and funded proposals will be shared frequently with the community. There is a suggestion to add an additional accountability/reporting layer to increase transparency. The Program Manager will share updates on the forum and through community calls. The proposal also mentions the need for enhanced accountability and monitoring of CGP statistics. The Program Manager will also share bi-weekly/monthly updates on the forum and through other communication channels. The proposal highlights the improvements made to processes, tools, workflows, and communication channels to ensure transparency. The proposal has been revised based on community feedback, and there are specific RFPs in the Security Domain. The proposal also mentions the importance of community contributions to improve protocol security. There are suggestions to consider the workload of domain allocators and to conduct surveys among grantees for feedback. Overall, the proposal aims to make CGP more effective and impact-oriented.
The author is expressing concerns about rushing an on-chain proposal to allocate funds to the Compound Grants Program (CGP) before important discussions have concluded and the community has had a chance to assess the value generated by CGP 2.0. They emphasize the need for caution and due diligence in making a substantial decision to allocate approximately $1 million. They also mention their involvement in the program and their commitment to improving the next iteration of the grants program. The author addresses some suggestions and questions raised by other community members regarding the program's structure and decision-making process. They clarify that CGP 2.0 has not been cancelled, but rather the proposal to renew it was cancelled to allow for feedback and improvements. They also mention the availability of funds for approved grantees and the goal of improving the program rather than stopping it altogether. The author provides updates on the renewed CGP 2.0, including the program manager and domain allocators, as well as the specific RFPs and budgets for each domain. They encourage interested parties to submit proposals and provide contact information for further inquiries. The author assures that they have been actively seeking feedback from the community and conducting votes to gauge sentiment before submitting the renewal proposal. They express openness to collaborating with other parties and revising the program based on transparent and decentralized processes. They invite Alastor & w3s 2 and Alphagrowth to engage in a discussion for potential collaboration. Finally, they request specific timelines and actionables for concluding discussions and emphasize their commitment to transparency and optimization for the benefit of Compound.
Compound Labs is structuring processes with inputs from the community for the CGP. They encourage interested parties to participate in discussions and polls. They will gather feedback and present a refined proposal for consideration. The mini grantee from torque.fi expresses gratitude for the opportunity and invites feedback. They are preparing for audits and the Arbitrum mainnet launch. They mention a stablecoin update and express interest in discussing learnings from Compound's research and development. They also mention a proposal to shore up incentives for the Arbitrum USDC.e market. They emphasize the need for profitability and spread in the market.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The Comptroller contract is facing a problem where predatory liquidators are burning the liquidation incentive in gas fees, causing community liquidators to be discouraged. A possible solution is to split the liquidation incentive between the liquidator and the protocol reserves. This would benefit users and COMP token-holders and reduce the risk to the protocol. Gas optimizations can also be made to benefit community liquidators. However, decreasing the liquidator incentive may reduce willingness to liquidate. The deployment of these changes would apply to certain cTokens and major collateral markets. Future improvements could include dynamically weighting the incentive and adjusting it based on time. There are concerns about misaligned incentives and the perception of the protocol. A gas limit is not recommended as it could hinder liquidations during times of high volatility. Frontrunning bots and their efficiency are also discussed. Further research and grants may be needed to address these issues.
The problem with the current oracle design is that liquidators can post new prices themselves, leading to gas price races. It is suggested to replace the current oracle with a better solution like Chainlink. Gas efficiency is important in the design of the medianizer. There is a discussion about the behavior of certain liquidation bots deliberately spending the liquidation incentive on gas. There is a suggestion to require that gas prices be below a certain threshold to limit gas racing. However, this may lead to spam transactions. It is suggested to transfer a percentage of the seizetokens to the liquidator and the Comptroller. The first-come, first-served approach to liquidation incentives is seen as a problem in DeFi. B.Protocol is working on a solution. Back running and spam can be prevented by implementing solutions like price kicks. The liquidation incentive can be split between the liquidator and the protocol reserves. It is important to eliminate MEV players and sophisticated bot liquidators. Bprotocol and Defi Saver offer solutions to keep asset value within the protocol and provide predictable profits for liquidators. It is necessary to remove parasites that influence the protocol. Clear speculators and arbitrage bots are seen as a clear use case, but the goal of DeFi is to fix the shortcomings of the traditional financial system. The protocol must attract real businesses and create real value. Reducing the liquidator incentive may create issues for Compound with dusty borrowing positions.
The original problem is that liquidators are burning the 8% incentive as gas fees to miners. One proposed solution is to reduce the incentive to 5% and add a 3% liquidation fee paid to reserves. Another proposal sets an upper limit on the gas price in a liquidation. A third proposal separates the updating of oracle prices into a preceding transaction. However, none of these proposals address the underlying problem of miners skimming the incentive. Two possible designs suggested are a dutch auction with a gradually increasing incentive and a fixed high incentive combined with a sealed-bid auction.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The Compound protocol experienced a DAI liquidation event where the price of DAI on Coinbase Pro spiked to $1.30, causing liquidators to seize collateral from addresses borrowing DAI. A total of 124 addresses were impacted, and there are discussions about potential changes to prevent similar events in the future. Some users are calling for compensation for their losses. The protocol's reliance on the Coinbase Oracle is being criticized, and there are suggestions to switch to decentralized oracles like Chainlink. The incident highlights the need to address vulnerabilities in the protocol.
The text discusses the recent exploit in the Compound protocol through a manipulated oracle, which led to mass liquidations. It suggests several remedies, including compensating the victims, addressing the oracle vulnerability, and investing in a robust oracle system. It also highlights the importance of community involvement and the need for affected individuals to hold COMP tokens for voting power. The text emphasizes the need to gather data and fully understand the event before discussing prevention measures.
The potential change plan is unclear. The discussion revolves around the need to protect Compound users and the protocol's solvency. There is a suggestion to use the lowest liquid price for borrowed assets and the highest prices for supplied assets to defend users. The recent exploit and loss of assets are mentioned, and the use of off-market prices is criticized. The need for compensation for affected addresses is raised, and the stability of stablecoins is questioned. The importance of risk management and the use of longer time intervals for price calculations are also discussed. The integration of Chainlink Price Feeds is proposed as a solution to improve data quality and prevent market manipulation. The vulnerabilities in Compound's oracle design are highlighted, particularly the reliance on Coinbase as a single point of failure.
Compound's price oracles are vulnerable to issues and do not provide adequate market coverage. This puts over $3B in user funds at risk. Chainlink Price Feeds offer a solution by providing accurate and resistant price data. Chainlink uses professional data providers, security reviewed node operators, and oracle networks to prevent manipulation and ensure reliable data. By integrating Chainlink Price Feeds, Compound can mitigate oracle-related issues and prevent false liquidations. This proposal aims to secure user funds and allow Compound to focus on innovation.
The content discusses issues with the Compound oracle and the need for improvements. It mentions the volatility of DAI on Coinbase and questions why the oracle allowed a price deviation. It also raises concerns about market makers and suggests integrating Chainlink price feeds. Additionally, there is a proposal for compensating users affected by the liquidation events. Some users express frustration with the lack of action and attention to the oracle issue.
Coinbase is experiencing issues with transactions and buys not completing, causing a discrepancy in prices compared to other exchanges. This is impacting derivative indexes and trade algorithms. Coinbase is known for being an unreliable data source, with frequent crashes and price spikes. There is a proposal for compensating victims of a previous exploit, with suggestions to address previous criticisms. One criticism was that too much compensation was going to whales, but the proposal aims to distribute compensation more accurately. There is a discussion about excluding accounts engaged in recursive farming from compensation. The formula for determining compensation can be revised, but the focus is on agreeing on the best way to determine compensation based on user behavior.
The Dai reserve is currently low, so compensation may need to be distributed over time or discounted. It would be helpful to reach a consensus on whether compensation should be discounted and by what percentage. Modulating compensation based on user behavior is not necessary; instead, the incentive structure should be changed to discourage yield farming. There are concerns about the alignment of interests in the protocol and the lack of accountability from Compound. Users are disappointed and considering moving their funds elsewhere. There is a proposal for restitution that is being discussed. The issue needs to be fixed, and 0xb1's compensation proposal is seen as fair.
Several protocols, including Nexo and Celsius, have taken responsibility for faulty oracles that led to false liquidations. However, Compound has ignored the issue and has not made any changes to prevent it from happening again. Users have suffered significant losses, with tens of millions of dollars falsely liquidated. The Compound community has even rewarded someone for proposing improvements to the platform, further adding insult to injury for those who lost funds. Reimbursing the liquidation fees would be a minimum step towards addressing the issue. If Compound does not resolve the situation satisfactorily, legal action may be pursued.
The post reintroduces a compensation proposal for users affected by the DAI liquidation event on November 26th, 2020. The original proposal did not pass, but now with the implementation of Chainlink Price Feeds and increased DAI reserves, a new proposal is being considered. The new proposal would use DAI from the reserves to compensate affected users. Some community members suggest using COMP instead of reserves, but others argue that building reserves is important for the long-term health of the protocol. The post also highlights the importance of reputation and compares Compound's response to similar events in other DeFi protocols.
Oracle has been fixed now, so there is no need for other Oracle solutions. A CAP has been deployed and needs 65k COMP delegate votes to become a formal proposal. Please consider delegating your votes to support this proposal.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/dai-liquidation-event/642$$;

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$AlphaGrowth is proposing a Compound Growth Program to increase the utility and revenue of the Compound Protocol. They plan to focus on chain integrations, token listings, partnerships, assisting the Compound Grants program, and marketing Compound's expansion. The program will involve research, outreach, sales engineering, negotiations, market research, risk assessment, outbounds, and partnerships. The goal is to increase TVL on Compound and bring more quality applications to the Grants program. AlphaGrowth will also engage in general growth, data research, and marketing efforts. The deliverables include conversations and negotiations with chains, integrating with chains, nurturing partnerships with tokens, and supporting the Grants program with applications.
AlphaGrowth proposes a 6-month growth program for Compound. The program includes platform integration, AMAs, and content creation. The team will prioritize planning and research in the first 45 days and focus on communications and conversions for the rest of the time. They propose allocating 18,000 COMP Tokens for the program and will conduct a post-program audit. AlphaGrowth has experience in DeFi and Crypto BD and has facilitated business development for multiple protocols. They will provide monthly and quarterly progress reports to ensure transparency. However, there are concerns about the proposal, particularly regarding chain integrations and token listings. Other chains and projects are already working to integrate with Compound, so paying a third-party may not be necessary.
The proposal is to scale down the scope of Chain integrations and focus on research rather than action. The proposed approach involves conducting a viability check for potential integrations with top chains in the market. The check includes risk analysis, security analysis, and recommendations. The cost of the analysis will be covered by the requestor chain through a research micro-grant. The viability report and recommendations will be advisory in nature and will not have a binding effect. Prospective chains will still need to follow community guidelines and procedures for integration proposals. The goal is to create a Go-to-Market strategy and package Compound in a way that new markets can be evaluated and eventually integrate Compound. The current process for new market expansion will be slowed down to work on the GTM strategy.
The proposal suggests separating Liquidity and Bootstrap Loans after the GTM strategy is approved by the community. It also mentions the need for clarity in the Marketing section regarding spend vs operation expenses. The focus is on increasing Compound usage and embedding the protocol with existing markets. There are objections regarding Compound chasing Chains and Assets, the estimated value of new markets, and the price of services. Alphagrowth's value-add is questioned, as Compound is already on most major L2s and Alphagrowth lacks engineering resources. A trial period is suggested to determine if Alphagrowth is a good fit. The proposal also discusses the potential for Compound to be both a solution and a market provider for L1 and leading L2s. Grants and incentives for new chain integration are mentioned. Content creation efforts may be shifted to Alphagrowth's proposal. The limited utility of research on chain and asset growth is highlighted. A revised budget for the trial period is proposed. The Growth program and CGP are seen as complementary and aligned on many topics. The focus of the Growth program is on Research, BD, and Marketing.
The Compound Growth Program proposes to fill the position of a growth partner for the protocol. The program will focus on increasing V3 integrations, users, wallets, and TVL on the platform. It will also include marketing activities to generate awareness and demand for the protocol products. The program consists of three components: research, business development (BD), and marketing. The research component will involve market research, data analytics, and research on DeFi trends. The BD component will focus on identifying potential partners and implementing an AlphaGrowth Strategy. The marketing component will identify key marketing channels to partner with. The proposal suggests a commission-based approach for the growth program and emphasizes the importance of collaboration with the Compound core team.
AlphaGrowth is offering business development (BD) services to Compound to help with their growth and expansion. The BD program will focus on building relationships, integrating with other protocols, increasing collateral assets, and increasing total value locked (TVL). The marketing strategy will involve co-marketing with partners and communities, advertising events and integrations, and incentivizing partner communities to use Compound. The program will run for 4 months in two phases, with a heavy focus on communications and conversions. The budget for the program is divided into a BD fund and a Growth fund, with unused funds being returned to Compound. AlphaGrowth has experience in DeFi and crypto BD and has successfully facilitated business development for multiple protocols. They will provide monthly and quarterly reports to keep the Compound community informed of their progress.
AlphaGrowth is proposing the Compound Growth Program to increase the growth of the Compound protocol. The program will focus on collaborations, education campaigns, V3 integrations, and expanding the Compound footprint. The program will also include marketing activities and robust research. Compound currently lacks a dedicated growth team, which has hindered its ability to keep up with competitors. The Growth Program will be a trial run over a period of 4 months to test different strategies for sustainable growth. The program will focus on marketing Compound, increasing V3 awareness, co-marketing with partners, and expanding business development opportunities. The proposal outlines specific targets for outreach and integration, as well as marketing strategies to promote Compound and V3.
The Compound Protocol is implementing a growth program to drive adoption. This includes integrating with new dapps, adding new assets to the platform, and launching on different chains. Paid campaigns will be used to promote Compound products, including KOL promotions, AMAs, and sponsorships. The program aims to measure success through metrics such as cost of marketing spend, user acquisition cost, and integrations. Deliverables include new infrastructure service provider integrations, sponsored content posts, co-marketing campaigns, KOL partnerships, AMAs, and sales pipeline creation. The program will gather data on different activities to determine what strategies work best for Compound. The budget for the program includes operational expenses and a growth fund for marketing and developer funding. AlphaGrowth, a experienced crypto BD firm, will be leading the program.
AlphaGrowth is committed to transparency and welcomes input and feedback from the Compound community. They will provide regular reports on the progress of their business development activities through community calls. They will also share progress reports on deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals, and learnings.

These include ending COMP rewards, refactoring COMP incentives, seeking liquidity from other protocols, adding supply caps, adding more assets, improving the oracle system, deploying Compound to Layer 2 solutions, transitioning off legacy CTokens, updating interest rate curves, deprecating old markets, updating the liquidation system, and upgrading testing and developer code base. These changes aim to make the protocol more efficient, profitable, and adaptable to the evolving crypto and DeFi industries.
GFX Labs is proposing to improve the Compound protocol and build a focused effort for the community. They have experience in Compound, DeFi, and crypto markets and are passionate about building a better financial system. The founders of GFX Labs have already made several proposals for Compound. They are active contributors and have worked on proposals for Uniswap and MakerDAO as well. Compensation for contributors is a pain point and incentives are important for driving resources. KPIs can be used to incentivize contributors and measure their performance. Revenues and token price are suggested as the best KPIs for aligning the contributor and the protocol. The debate on whether to pay contributors in governance tokens or stablecoins is discussed, with stablecoins being favored to avoid diluting existing holders.
The proposed compensation structure for GFX Labs includes a base fee and a bonus based on protocol revenues and the price of COMP. The bonus is earned when revenues increase beyond 50% and the COMP price increases. The model aims to align GFX Labs' compensation with the improvement of the protocol. The proposal also mentions the possibility of extending the partnership beyond one year. The community is encouraged to provide feedback on the proposal.
Compound Labs has been praised for their work in creating a great product. However, there is still room for growth in the DeFi industry and Compound protocol. GFX Labs has outlined a comprehensive to-do list for the protocol, which will require significant resources. The proposed base fee of $5M for a year is seen as sufficient to support GFX Labs in maintaining and improving the protocol. However, there are concerns about the proposed bonuses and their correlation with the price of COMP and revenue increases. It is suggested to drop the bonus compensation and renegotiate the contract after one year based on the work done. Other contributors are encouraged to participate in protocol development. The protocol can afford the proposed services through existing reserves and potential KPI achievements. Tyler Loewen plans to submit a similar proposal and work together with GFX Labs. Gauntlet supports the proposal but suggests removing duplicate work and providing more information on the methodology for the initiatives.
GFX has agreed to evaluate risk for new assets and work on protocol development. They will also focus on COMP reward management and propose supply caps. GFX plans to seek liquidity from other protocols and add more assets to the protocol. They will improve the oracle system and deploy Compound to L2s and sidechains. GFX will also transition off Legacy CTokens and update the liquidation system. They will upgrade testing and developer code base, clean up the existing protocol, and separate revenue generation and risk management. Finally, they will rebalance reserves. The community will work with GFX to prioritize these initiatives and ensure they are building the right solutions for the protocol.
The bonus structure for GFX Labs is being questioned in terms of its alignment with incentives and the lack of clear deliverables and KPIs. The proposal suggests finding a balance between contributor flexibility and accountability to governance, as well as establishing a regular reporting schedule for GFX Labs. There are also concerns about using stablecoin reserves to compensate contributors and the potential increase in insolvency risk. The lack of vendor and project management disciplines in DAO governance is highlighted as a root problem. Suggestions are made to improve documentation and clarity in contracts.
GFX Labs and similar vendors can provide projects, justification and benefit to the DAO, deliverables, number of resources and hourly rates, effort and overall cost estimates, and timeline for delivery. Compound can negotiate hourly rates and award projects based on complexity. The proposal suggests focusing on 3-5 key performance indicators (KPIs) including profit growth, market share growth, and token price. Compensation for GFX Labs should be performance-based and tied to these KPIs, with significant COMP-based upside granted only if performance exceeds that of competitors. A Compensation Council could be formed to determine compensation details and benchmarks. Addressing technical debt is important for software engineering longevity and growth. Empowering specific individuals should be minimized in a DAO to avoid scope creep and social capture. The proposal should include more detail on committed resources and a process for regular reporting and evaluation. There should also be a process for identifying under-performance and off-boarding.
A suggestion is made to form a ""Compensation Council"" to address compensation details and benchmarks. The conversation discusses the amount of money being proposed and the need for clear KPIs and commitments. The importance of paying a premium for contributions and attracting talent is emphasized. Different compensation models are considered, including actual cost with profit margin or profit sharing. Model 3, which only offers rewards without risk to vendors, is deemed not sensible.
Compound should consider going multichain and maintaining the current rewards structure. A user suggests a compensation model that includes a base salary of $2m USDC per year and a $10m COMP component that vests over four years. They argue that this model would provide significant compensation while addressing concerns about stability. The user also emphasizes that the proposal should be viewed as hiring a ""full-time"" team rather than a contractor, and suggests that equity compensation should be included to align incentives for long-term success.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Chainlink 10 is a reputable and valuable blockchain protocol. The proposal is to add $LINK as a collateral asset for Compound. This would provide more financial freedom and capital efficiency to DeFi users, especially the unbanked. It would also benefit OTC desks by allowing them to borrow tokens at market rates for quick sales. Strategic governance voting using borrowed tokens would also be possible. While there is a risk in adding any asset as collateral, it would increase the value and utility of the Compound protocol. Risk can be managed by adjusting the collateral factor, reserve factor, and borrowing limits for $LINK. The optimal initial values for these factors are open for discussion. The Open Price Feed already supports LINK, making the process fairly simple. The security of the LINK token is a concern, particularly the ownership of a significant portion by a closed-source contract. Starting with a lower collateral factor for cLINK could help mitigate this risk. The distribution and control of LINK tokens is a topic of discussion, and it would be beneficial for the contract code to be published on EtherScan. Overall, the community is supportive of adding new assets and measures can be taken to ensure safety and liquidity.
Adding LINK to Compound can help limit losses if the Chainlink treasury contracts or wallets are vulnerable to exploit or theft. The contract at 0x98c63b7b319dfbdf3d811530f2ab9dfe4983af9d is an old Gnosis MultiSig wallet. Adding LINK with a collateral factor of 0, like USDT, is a good path forward. This would allow testing of the interest rate model and give time for stress tests and collateral requirements. There is a risk of price manipulation if dormant tokens are borrowed and sold, but the risk is low for an attack by the Chainlink founders. To mitigate risk, deposit caps or max collateralizable amounts based on trading volume could be introduced. The initial collateral factor for LINK can be set low to ensure the proposal passes, and it can be raised later. The COMP distribution for the LINK market can be adjusted to match cUNI. Reallocating COMP distribution from other markets can be considered.
The discussion is about adding a new market for LINK on Compound. There are suggestions to reallocate COMP rewards from other markets to maintain the same total distribution. The implementation contract for cLINK can be shared with cWBTC2. The initial exchange rate for cLINK is calculated based on the decimals of the underlying token. The proposal for the new market includes a collateral factor of 0%, reserve factor of 25%, and COMP speed of 0.0014625 for LINK, BAT, UNI, and ZRX.
The suggestion is to decrease the distribution of DAI and USDC in equal portions to create a distribution of 0.00195 for LINK. Another option is to draw the distribution for LINK from COMP. Deployments for Ropsten and Mainnet are provided. The proposal includes setting the collateral factor and reserve factor for cLINK. Simulations have been conducted and the proposal is ready to be submitted. There is a discussion about lowering the delegation threshold for proposals. The CAP for adding LINK lost its delegation, but there is a suggestion to propose it again.
There is a proposal for separate payments that is still undergoing code reviews and changes. Another proposal for TUSD is live. Proposal 46 to add LINK has passed the vote and can now be queued in the Timelock. LINK is traded on various exchanges with a 24-hour volume of over $400m. There are concentrated holdings of LINK, which could pose a risk to the Compound protocol.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$OpenZeppelin has proposed the creation of a Compound Improvement Proposal (CIP) system to enhance the Compound protocol. They have drafted a foundational CIP-1 to define the process for CIPs and their role in the Compound ecosystem. The CIPs can include governance processes, on-chain enhancements, off-chain tooling, and other improvements. The CIPs are separate from Compound Governor Proposals and serve as a way to solicit community feedback and acceptance before submitting on-chain proposals. They also provide opportunities for community participants to contribute and seek funding. There are three types of CIPs: Meta Process, Protocol Enhancement, and Tooling & Support. The CIPs go through a lifecycle that includes idea generation, drafting, peer review, approval by the Compound Working Group, and implementation. Meta Process CIPs are approved by COMP holders through a Signal vote, while other CIPs are implemented by the community. A successful CIP should include a preamble, abstract, motivation, specification/process, rationale, and optional security considerations. The community is encouraged to provide feedback on CIP-1 and attend the Working Group call to discuss next steps.
OpenZeppelin will focus on security recommendations from the cETH Price Incident Post-mortem. Feedback can be provided through email, Telegram, or Discord. The proposed structure of the Compound Improvement Proposal (CIP) is well-defined, and there is a suggestion to include a section on Legal Compliance. The Signal Vote is a process for COMP tokenholders to indicate their support or opposition to a CIP. The approval of a CIP and its implementation should remain separate processes. There are suggestions to improve the structure of the CIP, including adding sections for impact and alternatives considered. A working group call will be held to discuss CIP-1, and individuals can become CIP Editors by attending the call or messaging the organizer. The criteria for approving CIPs will be similar to EIPs, ensuring technical soundness and accurate descriptions.
The CIP-1 Working Group Call was held and the recording can be found here. The latest feedback has been incorporated into CIP-1, which has been updated with new sections and minor wording changes. A founding team of CIP Editors has been formed and their names have been listed. CIP-1 will now move into the Final Call stage for 14 days before a Snapshot vote. The voting process will use Snapshot on the Compound page, with no quorum and a simple majority. The vote will start on November 16th and end on November 23rd. The CIP repository will be managed by the CIP Editors under the Compound Finance GitHub Org. The Snapshot vote for the adoption of CIP-1 has started and will end in one week.

The funding will come from Compound's treasury, and the program will be limited to $1 million per quarter for a total of $2 million over six months. We suggest forming a committee of eight members to administer the grants. The lead member will be compensated with $5,000 upfront and $100 per hour thereafter. We are requesting a maximum of ~5,000 COMP for funding the grants, program setup and operational costs, and compensation for the program lead. The purpose of the program is to grow Compound's ecosystem, fund ideas that would otherwise not receive funding, and strengthen goodwill within the community. The program will prioritize protocol and parameter development, code audits, business development/integrations, advertising and sponsorships, hackathons, and bounties. Miscellaneous improvements that benefit Compound directly will also be considered for grants.
The CGP committee will prioritize grants based on three buckets: high, medium, and low priority. The program will begin shortly after the proposal passes and will run for six months. Applications will be accepted throughout the program, with a two-week cutoff before the end. The committee will evaluate applications and approve or reject them based on their benefit to Compound. Approved grants will be publicly disclosed. The committee members include a lead and seven reviewers who will hold the lead accountable. The lead will receive compensation of $5k upfront and $100 per hour thereafter. The program budget will cover setup and operational costs, and any unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury. Success will be measured by the number of funded projects, community engagement, and improvement to Compound's brand. The CGP is a pilot program, and its success will determine whether it becomes a full-time endeavor. The community is encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions.
A committee should be formed to incentivize and fund smaller initiatives that don't require full weigh-in from all COMP holders. The committee should be knowledgeable, transparent, and fair. The goal is to encourage broader community participation and compensate contributors based on merit. The current grants program is a pilot and the process may evolve based on feedback and data. The committee members have diverse backgrounds and experience in funding projects. Active community members are crucial to the success of the program. The committee acknowledges the need for individuals familiar with the protocol codebase. The timing of grants for protocol development will be determined based on the specific project's needs. The grants program will be evaluated after several months to assess its effectiveness.
A COMP grants program is being proposed to encourage developers and community members to contribute to the Compound ecosystem. The program aims to provide funding for development and audit costs. The program will accept applicants at any stage of the development process and will prioritize the interests of users. Steps will be taken to verify the identity of applicants to minimize the risk of fraud. The program will have a fast and easy application process and approvals will be optimistic. The committee structure for disbursing funds is seen as a tradeoff to ensure the program runs efficiently and limits the risk of abuse. The program may include incentives for committee members tied to achieving certain metrics. Transparency will be a key aspect of the program, with all applications and decisions being publicly visible. Some concerns have been raised about the committee membership and the need to address issues before implementing the program.
The committee membership for the grants program is being questioned, as some members have never participated in the community. However, there is a volunteer who understands the Compound codebase and may join the committee. The process for the grants program should be more defined and there should be a way for the community to vote on issues related to the program. There are concerns about the practicality of distributing $1M per quarter and it may be better to scale up the grants spending gradually. The lead and reviewers have a tentative process for reviewing and approving grants. An off-chain method for voting on changes to the committee will be implemented. The proposal has been updated based on community feedback, including changes to the committee membership.
The final committee for the grants program includes Larry Sukernik, Jesse Walden, Getty Hill, Monetsupply, Aparna Krishnan, Leighton Cusack, Min Teo, and Nick Cannon. A suggestion was made to set up a Snapshot page for the community to vote on amendments to the program. Gauntlet's address is being used to post the proposal on-chain.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$This is a thread discussing compensation for users who were liquidated on 11/25. The market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro triggered the liquidations. Impacted users are requesting compensation. Questions to consider include whether the market price was fair, if users were aware of the risk, and if compensation should come from reserves or by distributing COMP. It is suggested that limited pro-rata compensation based on asset reserves could be considered. The purpose of Compound.finance is also discussed, with some users expressing concerns about manipulation and the need for compensation. One user suggests offering COMP distribution to affected users. The question of whether compensating users creates a social contract is raised, along with the potential impact on future user activity.
The protocol has a sizable inventory controlled by Governance, but doesn’t yet have a function to send COMP to an address outside of the use-based distribution; this would require a protocol upgrade. Gauntlet has an in-development branch  1 which includes this feature. The market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro was not fair and may have been intentionally manipulated. Impacted users were not fully aware of the risk associated with the oracle system. Compensation should be considered for impacted users, either from reserves or by distributing COMP. The protocol should be upgraded to address the oracle vulnerability.
The user believes that compensation for the protocol malfunction should come from the reserves to minimize the impact on COMP holders. They argue that compensating users will increase trust in Compound and attract more users. The user also addresses questions about the fairness of the market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro and whether impacted users deserve compensation. They believe that impacted users do deserve compensation because they suffered as a result of the protocol's error. They emphasize the importance of trust and community support in the DeFi space. The user suggests that a basic estimation of losses based on major liquidations could be used to calculate compensation. They stress the need for a quick resolution to maintain trust in the project.
Users impacted by the incident on Compound should not be compensated, according to rleshner. He argues that users have a responsibility to understand the risks associated with using the protocol and that compensation would encourage risky behavior in the future. He also criticizes the use of the term ""safe max"" in the Compound UI, stating that there is no such thing as a completely safe amount to borrow. rleshner believes that users should take personal responsibility for evaluating and managing the risks involved in using Compound.
The Compound protocol was attacked through oracle manipulation, leading to improper liquidations and seizure of collateral at incorrect prices. Users were misled by the UI into believing that borrowing up to 80% of their power was safe. The protocol has insurance funds set aside, but there is a lack of discussion regarding compensation for the victims. The market price of DAI on Coinbase Pro was not fair and should not have been used for liquidations. Users were not aware of the risks and were told by the UI that borrowing power was safe. Impacted users deserve compensation to admit fault and mitigate the impact. Compensation should be calculated based on the market value of seized collateral minus the true market value of DAI repayment. It can come from reserves or by distributing COMP. Compensating users does not create a new social contract but is implied through the setting aside of reserves. Failure to compensate users may harm Compound's reputation. Other DeFi protocols have compensated users in similar situations.
The argument revolves around whether or not users impacted by the exploit should be compensated. One user argues that the users should have been aware of the risks and that compensation sets a bad precedent. Another user suggests that compensation should be considered and proposes a solution involving a token with more voting rights. The discussion also touches on the volatility of stablecoins and the need for better protection for users. The outcome of the debate is uncertain, as it depends on the voting power and opinions of the community.
The community is discussing the next steps to address the issue of liquidations on Compound. Some suggest bringing a proposal up for a vote, but there are concerns that the community's interests may not align with the platform's. The lack of accountability and control in decentralized governance is also highlighted. Users affected by the liquidations are calling for compensation from the insurance fund or treasury reserves. However, it is noted that the majority of voting power lies with early investors and VC funds. The community is encouraged to reach out to influential investors and make a case for compensation. The need for a sustainable oracle solution and a vote to determine the amount of compensation is also mentioned.
There is a proposal to increase the DAI Reserve Factor to compensate users affected by the liquidation incident. Users can delegate their votes to support this change. Gauntlet has also proposed upgrading the protocol to distribute COMP, which is a prerequisite for compensation. The community is responsible for driving changes to the protocol and everyone in the thread has received COMP to participate. There is a live proposal for compensation and users can delegate their COMP to support it.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Gauntlet provides three options for the community to consider regarding Reserve Factors for Compound II: decrease Reserve Factors by 0.025 for USDT and DAI, increase Reserve Factors by 0.025 for USDT and DAI, or wait until Compound III is live. The analysis focuses on the value of the reserve factor as a parameter for navigating volatile markets and maximizing revenue for the protocol. The analysis also examines the impact of reserve factor changes on borrower interest rates and supply. Gauntlet recommends options 1 and 3 as the most prudent options. The limitations and tradeoffs of each option are discussed.
The text discusses the proposal to decrease reserve factors in Compound III. The author argues that reducing reserve factors may not significantly impact the market rate or market share of Compound. They also mention that the focus should be on increasing borrowing rather than supply. The user base of Compound is primarily traders and speculators, and there is a lack of quality collateral assets. The author questions the logic behind decreasing reserve factors and suggests that more borrowing is needed.
The author suggests making changes to the Reserve Factors (RF) in the Compound protocol. They propose increasing the RF for ETH and WBTC from 0.2 to 0.75 to incentivize more supply of these assets. They also suggest increasing COMP distribution for the supply side of ETH and WBTC to further promote their usage. For stablecoins, they recommend leaving DAI and USDC RF intact, but potentially decreasing the RF for USDT as an experiment. The author believes these changes will stimulate usage of collateral markets and potentially lead to more usage of stablecoin markets as well. They acknowledge the need for data on elasticity and suggest evaluating and adjusting the RF in the future.
The author suggests running an experiment to collect data on borrower elasticity by adjusting the reserve factor (RF) for USDT and DAI. They believe that borrowers may be more reactive to changes in borrow interest rates in recent months and that this is an opportunity to collect data on borrower preferences. However, they caution against increasing the RF for DAI, as it may put unnecessary downward pressure on the supply rate. They also provide some calculations on the potential increase in reserves from adjusting the RF.
The suggestion is to increase the reserve factor (RF) for WBTC and ETH markets to 0.75 and simultaneously double the supply side distribution of COMP for those markets. The RF for DAI should remain intact for now until results from USDT adjustments are obtained. The RF for USDT should be increased to 0.1, which will increase reserve growth for the protocol. Alternatively, the RF for USDT can be decreased to 0.05, but this may result in a net loss of reserve growth for that market. The RF adjustments for WBTC and ETH are seen as more impactful for the protocol and users, while adjusting RF for stablecoins is considered less impactful. The timeline for observing validation of further decreases in reserve factors and proposing further decreases is uncertain and depends on factors such as TVL, borrower behavior, and market volatility. The increment of 0.025 was chosen based on statistical analysis. Changing reserve factors in different directions creates noise in the data.
The suggestion to raise reserve factors and incentivize supply with additional COMP rewards is not recommended. While COMP rewards currently make supplying on Compound more profitable, these returns fluctuate with the price of COMP and are not sustainable in the long term. Adding additional inflation to the interest rates by increasing COMP reward spend would not uncover elasticity of users to real interest rates and reserve factors. Additionally, changing the ETH reserve factor may be challenging due to the upcoming ETH merge. It would be difficult to attribute observed supply/borrow behavior changes to a reserve factor parameter change in this context. Compound III is still in a preliminary testing phase, and if it proves to be more efficient, reserves could potentially be migrated to a version with too few reserves. However, it is suggested to wait and design a framework for Target Reserves based on borrowing volume or other metrics to determine the appropriate reserve levels.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/reserve-factor-consensus-for-the-compound-protocol/3487$$;

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$OpenZeppelin, a top smart contract security firm, is proposing to implement security solutions for the Compound protocol. This comes after Compound suffered an exploit that resulted in the loss of around $50 million worth of COMP. The exploit was due to a flaw in a governance proposal that allowed lenders to drain the treasury. OpenZeppelin suggests hiring a top-tier smart contract audit firm to review every governance proposal before it is executed on-chain. They also propose the appointment of a Protocol Security Officer (PSO) to act as Compound's security advisor and provide guidance on governance process improvements. OpenZeppelin will offer security training and resources to the community on secure smart contract development best practices. They will also conduct continuous security audits of new governance proposals.
OpenZeppelin proposes additional security measures and a comprehensive audit of Compound's smart contracts. They will provide threat detection monitoring and alerting, as well as ongoing communication and education. The engagement is proposed for one year with a fee structure based on the retainer fee and performance fee. The services provided are valuable, but the $8 million price tag seems high. The number of protocol changes and the scope of the changes suggest a lower cost. The performance fee based on securing the protocol is questionable.
The pricing for the security audit proposal by OpenZeppelin is being questioned due to the high cost. The performance fee does not align with the incentives, as the expected payoff for the effort put into improving security is minimal compared to the cost. OpenZeppelin has had audits from various companies and recommends a re-audit of the current code and systems. OpenZeppelin justifies their pricing by offering comprehensive security solutions beyond ad hoc audits, including threat monitoring, security education, and advisory services. They also emphasize the reputational risk and alignment of interests with Compound. Blockchain @ Berkeley supports the proposal but suggests considering a bug bounty program in addition to the audit. The Compound community has seen significant growth and upgrades under their watch.
Compound is considering a proposal from OpenZeppelin to provide security audits for the protocol. The proposal comes after a recent incident highlighted the need for better management of risk in the open-source model. OpenZeppelin has a strong reputation in the blockchain security industry and has experience working on the Compound protocol. While the price tag for the audits may seem high, it is reasonable considering the quality of OpenZeppelin's services and the need to safeguard Compound. The community will have the opportunity to assess OpenZeppelin's performance and decide whether to renew the contract. There are still some questions about the scope of the audits and the process for scheduling them, but overall, the community is supportive of the proposal.
OpenZeppelin will conduct an initial audit of the Compound protocol, including the governance contract and Comptroller. The audit will take approximately 7-9 weeks. OpenZeppelin will submit a retainer fee portion of their proposal for a vote, with the performance fee to be submitted later. Trail of Bits also has a proposed solution and highlights their experience and expertise in securing blockchain systems. They plan to review all governance proposals, provide security recommendations, and contribute a ""Security Considerations"" section to each proposal. They will also offer community training and continuous improvement for proposal authors.
OpenZeppelin is proposing security measures for Compound, including workshop sessions with developers, a minimum-security checklist, on-chain monitoring evaluation, and security intelligence. They also outline their pricing structure, which includes a quarterly retainer and performance fees. OpenZeppelin encourages the community to vote for their proposal and suggests that delays in implementing security solutions compromise the security of high-value projects. They also mention that a counterproposal from another security firm would have been valuable if brought forward in a timely manner. OpenZeppelin assures the community that they are confident in their ability to deliver best-in-class security solutions. They ask those interested in Compound's security to vote for their proposal. They also address the urgency of the issue and highlight the differences between their proposal and Trail of Bits' proposal. OpenZeppelin believes that their proposal focuses more on reducing risk in governance proposals and increasing security by reducing the cost of control. They also mention the importance of considering other quality assurance resources and studying the value and limitations of on-chain monitoring. They conclude by urging the community to vote ""Yes"" if they want Compound to be protected by OpenZeppelin starting from December 1st.
OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits have submitted competing proposals for security solutions for Compound. The community is encouraged to evaluate both proposals and make a decision. OpenZeppelin has requested a vote to start on December 6, 2021, with the proposals locked one week before the vote. There are concerns about conflicts of interest and high-pressure sales tactics from OpenZeppelin. It is suggested that community members start a forum thread before reaching out to vendors and that vendors keep proposals in line with the request. The cost structure of OpenZeppelin's proposal is also questioned.
The need for a first-tier audit of the Compound codebase is emphasized, as the current ad-hoc deployment of code changes is deemed risky. The security of listed coins is also highlighted as crucial for the overall security of the protocol. It is suggested that individuals making code contributions should not be responsible for negotiating and funding their own audits. Instead, proposals from external auditors like OpenZeppelin (OZ) and Trail of Bits (TOB) are recommended. The idea of establishing an internal security team for Compound is mentioned as a long-term solution. However, in the short term, implementing one of the current proposals is urged to improve security. The concept of performance fees is opposed, and it is suggested that payment in COMP tokens would be a good alignment. Both OZ and TOB are acknowledged as reputable auditors, with a preference for the OZ proposal due to its added value. The current proposals are considered overpriced, but still valuable for the protocol.
The author suggests that Compound protocol needs an audit and a system for auditing future changes. They propose two options for choosing an auditor: tokenholders delegate purchasing authority to a group of individuals or tokenholders vote on the vendor. The author agrees with Open Zeppelin's suggested dates for the vote. Open Zeppelin requests that the vote start on December 6, 2021, and that the proposals be locked one week before the vote. The author acknowledges some misunderstandings and assumptions made during the process and expresses a willingness to revise their proposal based on community feedback.
DAOs face the challenge of ensuring security in their projects. Instead of outsourcing security to a vendor, DAOs should leverage the strength of the security community. The main security challenge for DAOs like Compound is the growing complexity and the need for compatibility with previous versions. To address this, a suggested process includes early feedback during the RFP stage, thorough code review, development of an audit suite, tool-based analysis, and proposal verification. The focus is on prevention rather than monitoring. To find suitable code reviewers, Compound Governance can onboard auditors through a paid training phase. The auditors can benefit from the existing audit suite and collectively improve its coverage. The audit suite provides many benefits, including capturing expert knowledge, simulating the effects of proposals, simplifying governance proposals, reducing review cycles, automating tasks, ensuring correctness of proposals, and providing a decentralized mechanism for community inspection. Overall, the audit suite can provide scalability for DAOs.
Our suggestion is to incentivize broad participation from small to large security companies in order to broaden the base of experts in Compound and leverage proven techniques. This can be achieved by using an audit suite to aggregate knowledge and insights from multiple audits, rather than relying on just one. This approach allows each security provider to contribute based on their strengths and enables decentralized verification of proposals by any community member. We believe that this provides a viable long-term solution.
Trail of Bits will provide consulting services, security engineering, and repeatable processes to enhance the security of Compound. They will maintain a presence on Discord and the Compound forums, provide counseling sessions to proposal authors, review and report security issues, define security properties, and document security considerations. They will also host community calls, provide guidance to developers, customize security tools, and develop processes for proposal self-assessment and risk assessment. Additionally, they will design processes for evaluating third-party protocol integration risks and for other protocols to securely integrate with Compound. They will regularly update a ""treasure map"" for bug hunting. Risks include unknown security vulnerabilities and the potential for risky proposals to be voted for.
OpenZeppelin will provide continuous audit services for all Compound governance proposals and work with the community to develop security requirements and implement best practice security monitoring. The fee for OpenZeppelin's services will be $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year. The proposal includes improving the process for security of community proposed upgrades, providing continuous audits and dedicated resources, creating security checklists and requirements, implementing an open security monitoring solution, and integrating other security program components. OpenZeppelin has revised its proposal based on community feedback and excludes performance fees. The timeline for the proposal includes starting the security process in December, performing a comprehensive audit in January, and providing continuous audits starting in February. ChainSecurity's proposal includes a shared audit suite to ensure continuity with multiple auditors and alleviate risks of switching auditors. The audit suite is a collection of test cases designed by each auditor to document potential attacks and vulnerabilities.
Multiple auditors will be working on Compound, contributing to the test suite and ensuring the security of the protocol. The audit selection process involves Compound governance voting for auditors, auditors applying in a standardized way, Compound governance voting for the auditors, auditors being onboarded into the system, and auditors working in partnership with Compound. The process also includes a proposal submission and voting period. Reverie, the company that initiated the audit search process, proposes to complete the vendor selection process on behalf of Compound and requests a $75k COMP grant for their work. The community multisig will be used for the voting process.
The author believes that anyone who adds value to a protocol should be able to benefit from their work. They see the fee for arranging an auditing firm as a step in the right direction. They suggest that tokenholders should only vote for one proposal to avoid overlapping vote dynamics. They propose two options for voting mechanics: direct voting for vendor selection and correlating proposals. They express their preference for OpenZeppelin as the top choice for the audit. They provide pros and cons for both Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin's proposals. They mention that Gauntlet is abstaining from the vote and look forward to collaborating with the chosen provider. They congratulate OpenZeppelin on their successful governance proposal. They introduce Michael Lewellen as the Security Advisor for OpenZeppelin and discuss the next steps for the audit process.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The proposal is to add MKR, AAVE, SUSHI, and YFI as new markets in the protocol. These coins are considered blue-chip DeFi tokens and will have a zero collateral factor, the same interest rate model as COMP/LINK, and a reserve factor of 25%. The community will confirm the deployment of the cTokens to mainnet and work with Chainlink to set up the new oracle. The proposal suggests starting with a collateral factor of 0% and no COMP distribution, with the intention of discussing and adjusting these parameters in the future. The contracts for each token have been redeployed and confirmed to be correct. There is support for the addition of these markets, and there is a suggestion to codify a framework for adding new assets in the future.
The proposer should ask themselves if their proposed market is ready for Compound and if they are willing to fight for it to be listed. The forum post should include a summary of the asset, token distribution, liquidity/trading stats, why Compound should add it, proposed parameters, and testnet deployment. If the forum post has a warm reception and the testnet deployment is good, the asset can be launched on mainnet. If the mainnet token deployment is successful and the community is happy, the proposer can make a governance proposal or CAP to add the asset. After the initial listing, the proposer should post a recommendation for a collateral factor and rationale. The community should be given an opportunity to give their input on the parameters. The proposer can use a similar asset on the protocol as a starting point for default parameters. A risk framework can be used to make asset listing decisions less arbitrary and more rule-based. Aave's risk framework can serve as a reference. MKR, AAVE, SUSHI, and YFI have been deployed to mainnet and will be valuable additions to Compound. The deployment parameters should be verified. Simulations should be conducted to ensure the proposal and market addition work as expected. The addition of xsushi as collateral should be considered to bring in more liquidity to the protocol. The new price oracle has been deployed.

The proposal involves updating the oracle implementation, delegating and proposing the update, voting, queuing, and executing the proposal. It also includes tests for the integration of cMKR, including accrue interest, minting, borrowing, repaying borrow, and redeeming. The text mentions the submission of the proposal on chain and the start of the voting period. It also discusses the possibility of grouping SUSHI, AAVE, and YFI in a future proposal. The benefits and risks of adding these assets are discussed, including the overlap with Compound's largest competitor and the potential for liquidity problems.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$After discussions with @getty, the author is proposing to pivot their previous COMP Rewards Adjustments proposal. The current COMP rewards program is ineffective as most of the distributed COMP is instantly sold off, diluting the share of existing users and token holders. The author suggests ending the current rewards program and starting a new one focused on kickstarting new markets. The action plan includes cutting existing rewards by 50% and then to zero, conducting R&D in interest rate models, and introducing a replacement rewards program called kickstart rewards. The proposal also includes code for adjusting the COMP reward rates.
The COMP token distribution mechanism is being criticized for not benefiting existing users and token holders. The distribution of COMP tokens is diluting their share of the protocol, as most of the distributed COMP is instantly sold off. However, it is argued that the share of the protocol for token holders remains the same, as COMP is a fixed supply token. The protocol's reserves benefit from the farming of COMP tokens, as they exchange COMP for stable coins. The current COMP distribution mechanism is seen as flawed, and improvements are suggested, such as using treasury reserves and protocol-owned liquidity. The wide distribution of tokens is seen as more beneficial for major bag holders rather than small users. The proposal to cut COMP rewards is being discussed, and a simulation of the proposal actions is provided.
The community is divided on the proposal to remove the remaining 50% of COMP rewards. Some believe that more time and input from the community is needed before making such a significant change. Others argue that the focus should be on decentralization and distributing tokens to those who contribute value to the protocol. There are concerns about the impact on the markets and the potential collapse of TVL in stablecoin markets. The community has not had sufficient discussion on the matter, and there are questions about who exactly represents the community. Overall, there is a need for more analysis and conversation before moving forward with the proposal.
The proposal suggests cutting COMP rewards to 0 in order to increase the decentralization of the protocol. Some users and projects in the DeFi ecosystem are not aware of this proposal due to low-frequency marketing. Notional Finance, a protocol built on top of Compound, opposes the proposal as it believes it would decrease Compound's usage and threaten its competitive position. However, others support the proposal, arguing that it would eliminate inflation and allow for new market opportunities. The protocol currently spends $57 million on COMP incentives, leading to 6% inflation. The proposal's potential downside is a lower Total Value Locked (TVL) and lower supplier rates, but it can be reversed if necessary. The discussion involves various stakeholders with different incentives, including users, tokenholders, and the core team.
The content discusses the challenges of balancing the incentives of tokenholders and core team members in the Compound protocol. It mentions the potential impact of reducing COMP incentives on the protocol's liquidity and revenue. The author suggests a more measured approach to reducing incentives rather than cutting them to zero. They propose a targeted reduction in incentives for non-core assets and stablecoins. The author also mentions the upcoming launch of Compound III and the need to find a better way to distribute COMP tokens to users. They express concerns about the potential negative impact on COMP value and the difficulty of regaining lost liquidity if incentives are removed. The author suggests coordinating with Aave for further rewards reductions.
The content discusses the ongoing discussion and voting on proposals to adjust COMP rewards in the Compound protocol. The author shares their perspective as a participant in the protocol and expresses surprise at the minimal impact of previous reward reductions. They believe that reducing reward rates for lenders and borrowers makes sense and that stablecoin lending can react quickly to changes in incentives. They also mention the need for a longer test period to fully understand the effects of the reward adjustments. The author ultimately votes against the proposal, believing that it is directionally correct but needs more time and adjustments. Other participants in the discussion express similar concerns and suggest coordinating with Aave. The ChicagoDAO External Governance Team votes against the proposal, citing the lack of a clear alternative and the potential negative impact on decentralization. The Gauntlet team controls the reserve factor parameter and there is discussion about the voting results and potential future actions.
The proposal for a new rewards program failed due to concerns about the negative consequences of completely removing the existing rewards and the lack of a clear path to decentralization without the existing program. The action plan for kickstart rewards involves incentivizing a certain amount of supply at a specific rate for a set period of time before cutting the rewards. Factors such as interest rate models, reserve factors, and collateral factors will be analyzed and adjusted as needed. Additional rewards programs will take time to develop. Tyler Loewen presented numbers for the kickstart rewards program and asked for feedback. He also suggested using KPI Options as a more sustainable rewards solution.
The proposal suggests implementing a kickstart rewards program to attract capital to new markets. The first $50 million of capital will earn an 8% annualized COMP incentive, while anything over $50 million will dilute the incentive linearly. After 3 months, the incentive rate will be adjusted down to zero. The goal is to have at least 20% of the initial supply stay in the protocol. The proposal has been compared to Aave's rewards program, which recently ended. The community is encouraged to consider incentives when necessary and to reward Tyler for his efforts. Additionally, suggestions have been made to stimulate multi-chain liquidity growth and provide more compound interest for COMP holders. A veCOMP model is proposed to replace COMP voting rights and share protocol profits with holders.

They plan to launch two Comet markets on Base mainnet: a USDC market with crypto majors as collateral and a WETH market with LSDs as collateral. Compound Labs has already deployed two instances of Comet on the Base Goerli testnet. The deployment aims to position the Compound protocol as a core DeFi lego on Base and onboard new users. Base's security profile is similar to Optimism, but there are some risks to consider. The smart contract system deployed on Base will be similar to that on Polygon and Arbitrum. Compound Labs is requesting an exemption to obtain a Compound Business Source License for the Base network. Gauntlet provides two options for risk parameters for the USDC and WETH Comets on Base. The options differ in their level of conservatism and assume different levels of mechanics testing.

The daily COMP supply reward distribution of 20 would yield a 1.90% Supply APR. The table shows how distribution and net APRs evolve based on the protocol's TVL. The community's feedback is welcome and a poll has been created to gauge preferences. Labs plans to make proposals to initialize the Base markets once all assets have been deployed and Chainlink price feeds are available.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound plans to update parameters in the protocol, including changing the collateral requirements for ZRX, BAT, and WBTC. They received feedback from the community regarding the need for more data from stress tests and analysis. The simulations show that the risk of insolvency for WBTC has increased due to adverse liquidations. They use Coinbase data to estimate slippage for liquidators and consider gas fees and transaction delays. Compound will create another proposal through the governance contract after receiving feedback on the proposed changes. One user expressed concerns about the impact on current borrow positions if the WBTC collateral factor is decreased. They also suggested accounting for on-chain liquidity in the model. Compound aims to minimize the impact on borrowers and continues to prioritize protocol safety and success.
The content discusses the need to consider on-chain liquidity when determining the collateral factor (CF) for WBTC in the Compound protocol. It is argued that WBTC is the most liquid coin on the Ethereum ecosystem, and the CF should reflect that. The content also mentions the importance of not changing the CF frequently to build a stable user base. Additionally, the content suggests advertising and supporting services like DeFi Saver to protect users' loans and provide better alert systems. There is a mention of Gauntlet's simulation models and the need to generate parameters based on data from stress simulations and algorithmic optimization. The content concludes by stating that the concerns raised by Gauntlet are enough reason to discuss lowering the CF for WBTC, but the proposed changes should be conservative to avoid immediate liquidation of users.
The proposal is to lower the collateral factor (CF) for WBTC from 75% to 65% in order to reduce the risk of insolvency. The author suggests that a more conservative approach in lowering the CF might be appropriate given the recent market volatility. They also express a desire for more transparency in the model assumptions used by Gauntlet, the company conducting stress tests. Gauntlet shares some data on liquidations and stress tests, showing that the risk in the protocol is increasing. They propose lowering the CF for WBTC to 65% instead of 60% to limit the immediate effect on borrowers. The author suggests implementing the CF reduction in steps to give borrowers time to adjust their positions. They also question the liquidity assumptions in Gauntlet's model. Despite their reservations, they support the proposal as a precautionary measure. The proposal is live and the author is happy to see it go live.
The protocol is at risk due to the liquidity of WBTC on Compound. The primary concern is if the market gaps around 17% in a short period of time, causing underwater loans and protocol debt. While the protocol has taken into consideration liquidation cascades and other factors, there is still a need for improvement, particularly in the oracle price. The liquidity of WBTC is unmatched by any other coin on Compound, but there is a risk involved. It is suggested to include liquidity from Curve and to focus on protocol growth and robustness. Additionally, there is a suggestion to create liquidity incentives for a liquid enough WBTC-USDC pair on-chain. The updated data input pipelines assume more liquidity for WBTC, reducing the expected losses in a Black Thursday event. However, the risk is still significantly higher for WBTC compared to other assets. The liquidity assumptions in the model are questioned, as WBTC has lower slippage than COMP and UNI for large transactions.
WBTC should be rated at a liquidity level above UNI. Liquidators can hedge WBTC risk with BTC reasonably well, but during a stress event, this may be less true. The size of the WBTC market presents a more complicated task at liquidation compared to assets like BAT and ZRX. Gauntlet simulation suggests a need for market sell of several hundreds of millions of WBTC with a 25% margin. Decreasing the collateral factor for WBTC from 75 to 70 or even 65 is reasonable. The WBTC parameter update should have been split from the ZRX and BAT adjustments in the vote. Compound governance allows changes every five days, and voting for changes that affect multiple parameters is in the best interest of the protocol. The relative liquidity of WBTC matters, not the total amount. Polychain supports a collateral factor reduction for WBTC to ensure protocol security, even if it may result in liquidating some users. Setting collateral factors should balance safety and capital efficiency. The vote brings up issues of volatility in collateral factors, a more graceful method of deleveraging users, and better pre-vote signaling.
The proposal to decrease the WBTC collateral factor from 75 to 70 is controversial due to the potential for forced liquidations. Some users believe that a less radical proposal, such as a decrease to 70, would have more support. Liquidating users' positions is seen as a poor user experience and could drive users away from the protocol. It is suggested that future proposals concerning protocol economic risk should have more analysis and that protocol infrastructure around risk management should be improved. There is support for the proposal from some voters, but others believe that risk can be mitigated in a more methodical approach. It is important to communicate the upcoming change in the collateral factor to users. Personal risk management is emphasized, as users should be responsible for managing their own risks. The debate over parameter changes is seen as positive, as it shows the community's motivation to see the Compound protocol succeed. The Gauntlet team has advocated for a reduction in risk associated with WBTC, but some voters believe that risk can be reduced without degrading the user experience. Suggestions include supply caps, protocol liquidation fees, external liquidation protections, and real-time alerts to borrowers. It is acknowledged that the proposal process for reducing the WBTC collateral factor could have been better. The focus now is on communicating the changes to users and building a system that can safely support a 75% WBTC collateral factor.
Pantera Capital is voting FOR Proposal 39 due to the limitations of the protocol and the urgency of the risk. The crypto markets are more leveraged and price-reflexive than in the past, making quick action necessary. The risk outlined in Gauntlet's analysis could be potentially damaging to the perception of decentralized governance. The size of WBTC on Compound and the timing realities are key factors in the decision to act quickly. The goal is to reduce risk without degrading the user experience. A new thread has been started to discuss liquidations now that the proposal has passed. Suggestions to minimize liquidations include contacting users through ETH transactions.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/zrx-bat-and-wbtc-parameter-update/1244$$;

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Consensys and PGov are proposing the deployment of Compound V3 on Linea, a zkEVM incubated by Consensys. Linea is a scalable L2 solution on Ethereum that allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts without modifications. The proposal suggests starting with an isolated USDC market with crypto majors as collateral. Linea aims to provide a seamless user experience for MetaMask users and has already attracted over 100 global partners and protocols. Security considerations include plans to decentralize the sequencer and prover and mitigate centralization risk through a security council. Technical implementation will be handled by Linea's onboarding engineers, and the deployment will follow Compound's cross-chain governance process. The proposal also discusses the evaluation of oracle providers, with Pyth being the proposed choice.
Linea is proposing to integrate Pyth as the oracle provider for Compound on their network. Pyth sources data from trusted institutions and offers secure and cost-effective high-frequency price feeds. They have obtained audits for various networks and have shown promising market adoption. The Linea team will fund, operate, and maintain the price pusher for Pyth integration. Redstone Finance also offers a push model, but both Pyth and Redstone have centralized aspects compared to Chainlink. However, Chainlink is not an option for Linea at this time. The goal is to find an alternative oracle solution that enables support for a deployment on Linea while maintaining security.
The proposed deployment for the Compound III oracle involves multiple entities running the price pusher, including Linea, Pyth, and potentially Gelato. This introduces additional layers of decentralization and trust assumptions. In the Pyth model, prices are pushed to an aggregation contract on Pythnet, attested by Wormhole, and then accessed by Linea, Pyth Foundation, and potentially Gelato through a price pusher. While the end result is the same as the Chainlink push model, the Pyth model requires trust in multiple entities and introduces a bridge and another chain. It is important to consider the implications and risks of this new approach to oracles.
The proposal suggests using Pyth as a primary oracle for Compound. However, it is important to note that Pyth is not the sole oracle used by projects like Venus and Synthetix. They use Pyth in combination with Chainlink. The proposal also mentions the possibility of using Tellor as another option or exploring a multi-oracle system. The concerns raised about trust assumptions in Pyth are addressed by explaining the role of Pythnet, Wormhole, and the price pushers. The Pyth team is invited to provide more technical details and answer questions about the oracle.
Pyth is a system designed for high reliability and performance, with zero downtime since its launch in Fall 2022. It supports both ""pull"" and ""push"" integrations for protocols like Compound. In a ""push"" integration, an off-chain service called the Scheduler 3 continuously updates the on-chain Pyth price. This introduces additional parties and potential risks compared to the current system. However, Pyth still allows permissionless price updates even in a ""push"" integration, eliminating reliability risks. The suggested implementation carries more risk than the current system, but it's a matter of whether that risk is acceptable. There are concerns about potential centralization in the setup, particularly regarding the Price Service hosted by Pyth. Incorporating solutions like Pyth can enhance the reliability and transparency of data feeds, mitigating concerns related to single-source dependency.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-linea/4460$$;

The budget for the fund is proposed to be $1.5M spread across 2 quarters, managed by 5 domain allocators. Each domain allocator would have expertise in their respective domains and their performance would be publicly viewable. The Compound community would have the opportunity to vote on the budgets for each domain allocator every quarter. The proposal aims to address issues with committee blind spots, manager burnout, and inadequate tooling in the current grant program. The program design involves delegating capital allocation to community members, running programs on-chain for transparency, and evaluating the performance of domain allocators regularly. The proposal also includes a list of suggested domain allocators and their respective roles and responsibilities.
The proposal suggests using the Questbook tool to disburse funds for grant proposals. The tool will be managed by domain allocators, with the eventual goal of having a manager elected from the community. The compensation for domain allocators is $10 per hour, capped at $500 per week, while the grant manager is paid $15 per hour, capped at $800 per week. The objective of the model is to align project domains with Compound's priorities and increase community involvement in the grant program. The proposal also mentions the use of various communication platforms and tools. Questbook is a decentralized grant orchestration tool used by other platforms like Polygon, AAVE, Celo, and Solana. The proposal includes details of the first quarter's progress, including the number of proposals received, approved, and milestones completed, as well as the funds committed and disbursed.

The author also addresses suggestions for including a project guide from the Compound Labs team and selecting important domains for the grants program. They provide a breakdown of potential domains and their percentages based on community voting. The author also discusses the proposed compensation rates for the grant committee and compares them to rates from other programs like Aave and Uniswap. They mention that the new proposed compensation is better than the previous one. There is a mention of the need to find domain allocators and a request for suggestions. The author also mentions the need for an open form for community members to share and refer potential domain allocators. They provide an update on the progress of the interviews for domain allocators and mention that the proposal will be open for voting soon. The author also addresses questions about the roles and responsibilities of domain allocators and the scope of the ""Risk Parameters update research"" domain.
The updates to the proposal include the selection of domain allocators for various domains, the finalized domains for the grants program, changes in the committee org structure, budget and committee compensation updates, and updates on the legal compliances of CGP 2.0. Milestone-based payouts will be implemented to ensure grant recipients deliver on their stated goals. Unused funds from the grants program will be returned to the treasury at the end of the program. The program will be marketed through the compoundgrants Twitter account and website.
The Questbook tool has 20K monthly active users who use it to apply for grants programs. The allocators and manager track their hours and submit weekly reports. The initial budget for each domain is suggested to be $200k for 6 months. The proposal will be put up for voting on November 28th. The domain allocators have been added as multisigs to the CGP 2.0 Grants SAFE. Questions are raised about the entity signing the contract, Questbook's compensation, the justification for higher costs, and the purpose of KYC for grant recipients.

The program will prioritize transparency, quick turnaround time, and oversight. The Blockchain Lawyers Group (BLG) will provide legal support. The program encourages interested individuals to apply through the QuestBook tool. The program has made progress in the last 15 days, including incorporating feedback and evaluating voting processes. The program aims to ensure grant recipients deliver on their goals and may return unused funds to the community. The program will be marketed through various channels, and the time spent by allocators and managers will be tracked.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound should integrate Chainlink Price Feeds to address the vulnerabilities in its current centralized oracle solution. The recent false liquidation of user funds highlighted the need for a more robust and accurate price feed system. Compound's current price feeds only reflect a small subset of the crypto trading market, making it susceptible to market manipulation and inaccurate pricing. Coinbase, the sole source of market data, has a history of downtime and flash crashes. While using Uniswap TWAP as a backstop provides some security, it can still be manipulated. Aave, another decentralized money market, successfully integrated Chainlink oracles to avoid price oracle issues. Chainlink's Decentralized Price Feeds offer full market coverage by aggregating data from multiple sources and preventing manipulated data from reaching smart contracts. Chainlink uses professional data providers, security-reviewed node operators, and on-chain reference contracts to ensure accurate and reliable price data. By integrating Chainlink Price Feeds, Compound can eliminate market coverage issues and prevent false liquidations. Integration is straightforward and would provide a tamper-resistant solution. This would allow Compound to focus on asset listing and risk parameters rather than dealing with oracle exploits. Additionally, integrating Chainlink would offer a wider range of coins and eliminate the need for volunteer-posted prices.
Using Chainlink price feeds can help fix the problems with Compound's oracle mechanism and support its scalability. Chainlink provides a proven oracle solution that can be quickly integrated across all of Compound's markets. By offloading oracles to Chainlink, Compound can focus on its core business model and launch new markets at an accelerated rate. Chainlink's shared cost model and decentralized governance also offer benefits to Compound. Compound can still retain its circuit breaker mechanism while integrating Chainlink as its primary oracle solution. Collaboration between Chainlink and Compound would benefit both ecosystems and lead to accelerated success.
The next steps to creating an autonomous proposal for a Chainlink Price Feed integration would be to gather at least 100,000 delegated votes and convert the proposal into a governance proposal. It is important to address the issue with the Compound oracle, which has weaknesses and uses only one price source. Adding more high-liquidity exchange reporters to the current oracle view is a potential solution. However, it is also necessary to consider market coverage and liquidity differences across exchanges, which data aggregators like Chainlink address. The goal is to ensure that protocols always receive the true market wide price.
The DAI/USD Coinbase trading pair only tracks a small percentage of DAI's daily volume. The majority of the volume comes from Uniswap, which is adequately tracked by Chainlink. Both the debt and market coverage issues need to be addressed. The longer Compound goes without ensuring market coverage, the more exposed user funds are to oracle manipulation. Adding more high-liquidity exchange reporters to the oracle view is the path forward. Artificially limiting market size is not the highest priority action. Chainlink has proven its ability to secure dApps like Aave and Synthetix without experiencing market coverage issues. Taking a median across exchanges does not solve the problem. Compound's current infrastructure needs to change. Full market coverage means taking data from all exchanges and weighting it by volume. Compound can still have a circuit breaker in place as a fallback mechanism. The oracle issue is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. Aave has had no price oracle issues during this event. Chainlink is the best solution proposed so far. There have been concerns about centralization and obfuscation, but Chainlink uses a large network of independent data sources.
It's difficult to understand concerns about centralization when Coinbase Pro is being used as a reporter, while Chainlink uses independent data sources. The negative sentiment may be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a reflection of the technical aspects. The Chainlink team is professional and the technicals are what really matter. There may be more constructive reactions in the future. Coinbase experienced a 60% deviation from the market-wide price on the SNX/USD pair. Expanding market coverage via Chainlink is necessary to avoid false liquidation events.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-to-integrate-chainlink-price-feeds/685$$;

The proposal suggests initializing Compound III on Polygon with USDC as the borrowable asset and seeding the market with 500k USDC. The launch involves raising the supply caps of collateral assets, deploying and upgrading to the newly configured implementation, and transferring 500,000 USDC from the Timelock to the new market. The reasoning behind using USDC as the borrowable asset is its high demand and the ability to ensure safer borrowing for users. The proposal also mentions the need for vetting assets and confirming/discussing price feeds. The cross-chain governance aspect is being worked on in the public GitHub repository.
The bridge receiver contract is responsible for receiving governance messages from the Polygon FxChild contract and forwarding them to the bridge timelock. The bridge receiver does not have any knowledge or details about assets like USDC. The governance decides the USDC address and constructs the protocol deployment using it. The bridge receiver is the local address for a contract that Governance believes to be a reliable proxy for its messages on the bridged chain.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The idea is to introduce isolated markets in Compound to support the lending and borrowing of any crypto asset. Isolated markets would allow for permissionless listings, but the risks would be contained within each market. This would provide more opportunities for stablecoin lenders to earn interest, with higher APRs for riskier assets. However, there are concerns about reputational risk and the potential for opportunistic projects to take advantage of novice users. It is important to educate users about the risks and develop a user interface that aids in risk assessment. The infrastructure for price oracles in isolated markets would involve using Compound's Chainlink powered UniswapAnchoredView if available, and if not, using a TWAP from a DEX aggregator like 1inch. However, there are challenges in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of prices from DEXs. Possible solutions include altering the amount used for price calculation or implementing volume/liquidity weighted prices with minimum liquidity constraints.
The author proposes building a new price oracle for isolated markets to support permissionless listing. They discuss strategies to combat price manipulation, such as aggregating DEXs, using sliding window oracles, and choosing the best algorithms for calculating prices. They also mention the need for a strong price oracle that is resistant to manipulation in order to allow anyone to create a new market without going through the governance process. The author provides an update on the progress of the new oracle infrastructure code and discusses the benefits of using an aggregated oracle for small-cap tokens. They emphasize the importance of an aggregated oracle for permissionless listing and suggest that Compound's price anchor could be upgraded to use an aggregate. The discussion includes suggestions for using data from multiple protocols and weighting the protocols based on price changes. The author concludes by stating their intention to focus more on this idea.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Gauntlet proposes making changes to the COMP distribution model to increase the incentive for long-term holding of COMP. They suggest reducing the emission rate of COMP and adjusting the distribution to suppliers and lenders. They also propose adding a vesting period or time-lock. Gauntlet has conducted analysis and simulations that show COMP is being overproduced by 35-40%. They recommend reducing emissions by 20% and will monitor the market reaction before making further adjustments. The proposal involves calling _setCompRate with a reduction of 0.176e18. If the proposal passes, Gauntlet will monitor COMP trading volumes, usage in farming protocols, and borrower/supplier statistics to guide future emission-related proposals. The proposal timeline includes three days for community feedback and analysis before submission on August 26, 2020. Gauntlet acknowledges the contributions of their team, Flipside Crypto, and Auditless.
The main challenge with implementing vesting is the technical aspect, as it requires a significant amount of work to ensure minimal impact on gas costs. The proposal suggests that option b) is the most favorable in the long run, but it requires auditing and implementation of vesting. The value of COMP is determined by future cash flows, and decreasing COMP distribution only addresses a symptom rather than the actual problem. The proposal emphasizes the importance of increasing long-term active governance participants. The team is working on code for vesting COMP rewards and has a sequence of proposals in mind. There is agreement that adding a vesting period is preferred over reducing COMP distribution. The farming and recursive leverage effects are driven by an irrational market, and reducing emissions may not have the desired effect. The community should discuss additional ways to distribute COMP, such as bug bounties and incentivizing integration with other platforms. The reduction in emissions aims to allocate COMP for future use in the protocol and incentivize long-term holding. The proposal suggests that lower emissions now and adding vesting is the correct approach.
The proposal to reduce COMP emissions is being questioned by some community members. They suggest alternative solutions such as reallocating undistributed COMP or using the already allocated COMP for community needs. The goal of reducing emissions to prevent farming and dumping COMP is also being challenged, as it is unclear how it would address this issue. Additionally, the reduction in emissions goes against the current market trend of faster emission rates leading to increased governance participation. Concerns are raised about the concentration of COMP in the hands of a few and the lack of user control in the governance process. The proposal is seen as a short-term attempt to pump COMP prices and lacks clarity on how the reduced COMP would be spent and benefit the platform and its users. Suggestions are made for a hybrid system of user control, where a portion of voting weight is distributed among active users and the remaining portion is commodified as COMP governance tokens. The argument is made that current COMP prices are inflated due to yield farming hype and caution is advised in making radical changes. The connection between reducing emissions and increasing long-term hodling is questioned, as the perceived value of governance is currently lower than the market value of the token. Alternative solutions such as increasing emissions and implementing vesting or giving COMP utility are proposed to incentivize long-term hodling.
There are counter arguments to the proposal to decrease COMP emission that have not been addressed. One argument is that most of the earned COMP is sold immediately, but this actually brings in new users who believe in Compound's future. Decreasing COMP emission is seen as a way to reduce recursive farming and distribute COMP to long-term holders. It is also a temporary fix while longer-term changes are implemented. The current distribution of COMP is not ideal, but it was the first DeFi token to have automated governance. The goal is to reduce short-term behavior, add vesting or lock-ups, and then increase issuance again. The argument that centralized exchanges hold a large portion of COMP is not valid because they are custodians, not owners. Analysis has shown that transfers to exchanges are not from small holders. Overall, the proposal is seen as a step towards a longer-term solution.
Compound's handling of the recent proposal has been disappointing and not in line with decentralized democratic principles. The community's feedback has been disregarded, which can alienate users and harm the community. The main issue with COMP distribution is not the emission rate, but the lack of utility for holders beyond speculation. Suggestions for additional utilities, such as dividends or discounts on borrowing fees, have been made. Slowing down decentralization through reduced emissions may not address the problem effectively. The feedback from the community has not influenced the proposal, and it does not encourage long-term holding. It is important for platforms to prioritize user interests to avoid disruption by competitors.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-022-systematically-reduce-emission-quantity/241$$;

The ETH market parameter changes aim to increase market efficiency and reduce the lending pool's utilization rate. An alternative is being worked on for the MIP Amendment Subproposal. The MIP Amendment Subproposals for Article 1 edits are seen as an improvement and support fleshing out AC requirements. The expansion of the Launch Project budget is massive but may be necessary for Endgame execution. The Ratification Poll for MIP Amendment Subproposal includes various changes such as redenomination, privacy requirements, and adjustments to collateral and stablecoins. The DAO Resolution Pertaining to HV Bank aligns with the Stability Scope. The Fortunafi Debt Ceiling should be decreased to align with the Stability Scope. The Executive Proposal includes various management and authorization updates. The Spark Protocol D3M Parameters need adjustment to support Spark's growth. The Spark Protocol DAI Interest Rate Strategy Borrow Spread should be adjusted to increase revenue and add risk. The Spark Protocol Flash Loan Fee should be adjusted to discourage the use of flash loans.
Resiliency AVC would have voted yes if there was MKR in this GSL. Flash loans are unlikely to be used if there are non-zero fees due to other free options, and this increased capability does not carry additional risk.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The Chainlink team has proposed launching oracle contracts for the Compound community to consider. They have a proven system with a team dedicated to oracles and are used by various DeFi protocols. Their systems have high standards for data quality and provide reliable price updates. They also offer tools for monitoring onchain performance. The cost for using Chainlink oracles would be $150 per oracle per month. The community would have the option to choose which nodes are added to the price feed. Overall, using Chainlink is seen as a strong move for Compound to improve oracle quality and focus on protocol development.
Chainlink is being considered as a solution for the oracle-related issues in the Compound protocol. Some members believe that incorporating Chainlink price feeds into the medianizer, along with other sources, would provide better market coverage. However, others argue that relying solely on Chainlink would diminish the value proposition of having multiple independent nodes. Chainlink Labs is supportive of the proposal and is working with the community to implement it on the testnet. They have created a pull request on the Compound github and deployed the necessary contracts on the Kovan testnet. Feedback from the community is being sought before moving forward with the implementation.
The Compound community is discussing what to do with the admin key for each price feed. There are four options: setting the admin to the burn address, setting it to the regular Compound governance key, using the Compound Community Multisig, or using the existing Chainlink multisig. The author suggests using the Compound Community Multisig as a middle solution. The author also discusses the role of the multisig admin key and the importance of having an admin key on the oracle network. The author mentions the economic incentives for nodes to post price data on-chain and the trust dynamic based on reputation and revenue.
The content discusses the importance of Chainlink price feeds and oracle networks in the Compound protocol. It mentions the financial incentives for node operators to continue publishing prices and the use of historical circuit breakers to prevent outlier data points. The author emphasizes that the decision on the admin key for each price feed should be made by the Compound community, with options including the community multisig or Compound Governance. The integration with Chainlink is seen as a way to increase the security of the Compound protocol. There is also a discussion on the use of emergency intervention and the potential for adding an emergency function to revert to Chainlink's main oracles. The post concludes by expressing support for the integration and offering assistance from reputation.link, an independent analytical service for Chainlink.
The text discusses the value of secure feeds and the importance of assessing the price feeds and oracles supporting them. It mentions that Chainlink has deployed contracts on the Kovan testnet and provides a platform to visualize and analyze the security guarantees of the data provided by the Chainlink network. It also mentions the resilience of Chainlink nodes during downtime events. The text further discusses the plan for Compound Governance to be the admin on the contracts and the emergency function for each market. It mentions the use of Uniswap v2 as an anchor and the upcoming publication of revised contracts for review and audit. The text includes comments from community members expressing support for the proposal and some concerns about Chainlink. It also mentions the rejection of Chainlink by the Compound Labs team in the past and presents an adjusted plan supported by Robert, Polychain, and blck.
The proposal discusses the switch from the current oracle mechanism to Chainlink price feeds combined with a Uniswap anchor. The current system uses the UniswapAnchoredView (UAV) with a configured reporter to post prices. If the reporter is compromised, the Uniswap V2 TWAP prices are used as a failover. The new proposal modifies the UAV to push prices from production aggregators and allows for failover and reversion of failover on a per-market basis. The architecture includes the use of OffchainAggregator contracts and a ValidatorProxy contract. Mainnet tests have been conducted, and the code for the UniswapAnchoredView, ValidatorProxy, and aggregators can be found in the provided links. The proposal aims to create a secure and accurate oracle system for Compound.
Compound Labs has raised some questions and concerns about the proposed architecture for switching to Chainlink. They are concerned about the management of the set of aggregators and the redundancy of price posting. They also have concerns about the process for adding new markets and the potential burden on governance. Compound Labs suggests using the shared Chainlink on-chain price feed and having the UniswapAnchoredView contract read updates from it. They also propose utilizing the existing Chainlink price feeds that other protocols are already relying on. Compound Labs believes that if these concerns are not addressed, governance is likely to reject the proposal. They express their excitement about the progress and their confidence in resolving the remaining questions.
The ValidatorProxy contract routes price data from aggregator contracts to the UAV contract, allowing for easy upgrades to new UAV contracts. The proposed system uses existing Chainlink Price Feed networks and does not create duplicates. The list of reporters, which are contract addresses, can be managed by governance and can be changed when needed. The new UniswapAnchoredView receives prices pushed by Chainlink Price Feeds through ValidatorProxy contracts. The frequency of updates depends on deviation and heartbeat thresholds.

The Chainlink Price Feeds used by the UAV have been successfully used by other DeFi projects and have operated without issues. The feeds can be audited using the Etherscan events tab on the Aggregator contract. The decimal conversion in the UAV contract is occurring as expected.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The community is discussing potential changes to the Compound DAI market. Some ideas that have been suggested include disabling DAI's COMP distribution, increasing the DAI reserve factor, setting a borrowing cap, lowering the DAI collateral factor, and implementing a supply cap. Other ideas are also encouraged. The current market size of DAI is a result of the COMP distribution and early imbalances. Risks are concentrated in certain accounts rather than the protocol in general. The current COMP distribution model may need adjustment, but completely disabling it for the DAI market is seen as unfair and radical. The reserve factor for DAI should be increased, and the collateral factor for USDC could be increased as well. The primary issue is seen as a brittle oracle design rather than the risk parameters of the DAI market. The DAI market on Compound is large compared to the total market cap, which can lead to manipulation and unreliable price oracles. Disabling the COMP distribution temporarily and addressing the oracle issue is suggested. Raising the DAI reserve factor would reduce borrowing incentives and build up reserves.
Compound is considering disabling COMP rewards for DAI, which could result in leveraged farming moving to other assets. The suggestion is to use USDC or ETH for farming instead, as they have more liquidity. The issue is not specific to DAI, but rather a problem with the Compound oracle, which only has one source (Coinbase). The vulnerability of DAI debt exceeding market liquidity is a fundamental problem that cannot be solved by changing the oracle. The only realistic solution is to reduce DAI outstanding debt. There are risks of under-collateralization and market manipulation when there is an excess of an asset in the system compared to market liquidity. The goal should be to select options that reduce Compound's DAI market risk. Some DAI borrowers are ""loopers"" who borrow and deposit DAI as a COMP farming strategy, but not all DAI in the system is ""perfectly looped"". The DAI liquidity is different from other assets, as it can always be sourced from MakerDAO at a $1 mark price. However, this does not resolve the lack of market liquidity for liquidators or the possibility of market manipulation. There is a proposal to increase the DAI Reserve Factor to 15% to address the issue.
The Compound oracle currently only tracks a single exchange, Coinbase, which accounts for only 2-7% of DAI's daily volume. This lack of market coverage allowed the cost of bidding DAI up to $1.30 to be relatively low. Aave, on the other hand, uses Chainlink which pulls data from a range of aggregators, providing better market coverage. It has been suggested that Compound integrate multiple price feeds to mitigate this risk. Additionally, the DAI debt on Compound is much higher than on Aave, making Compound more susceptible to market risks. Both the DAI debt size and the oracle market coverage need to be addressed to raise the cost of protocol manipulation. It is important for money markets to not let their collateral or debts grow to a point where it becomes profitable to manipulate market prices. Chainlink is seen as a better solution than using Coinbase Pro with Uniswap TWAP as a backstop, as it provides more trusted data sources and has proven performance during volatile market situations. It is necessary to fix both the faulty oracle and the DAI market parameters to prevent future issues.
Yearn has implemented a COMP farming strategy using flash loans to increase leveraged DAI in the system. A tweet by banteg on December 6, 2020, mentions the first harvest spotted on this strategy. The discussion about integrating Chainlink Oracles should be kept separate.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/dai-market-risk/688$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$A proposal has been made to distribute DAI to users affected by the DAI liquidations on November 26th, 2020. The proposal utilizes a modified version of the merkle distributor used for the Uniswap UNI token airdrop. The total expected compensation amount is approximately 6.8 million DAI. There is a suggestion to curtail the compensation amounts for two accounts that make up the majority of the compensation. The specifics of compensation caps/reductions could be adjusted. The community is discussing whether to compensate users affected by the liquidations and if the compensation should be in COMP or DAI.
The price of most liquidated assets has increased significantly. The 8% liquidation fee should be repaid to affected users, with a possible cap for large-scale farmers. Compensation should be based on the value of COMP at the time of liquidation. The issue should have been resolved sooner. Compensation should be paid in DAI instead of COMP. There should be more structure around future reimbursements. The CAP proposal needs 65k COMP delegate votes. Gauntlet agrees with using DAI over COMP and will model reserve growth. Proposal 49 allocates liquidation incentives to reserves. Gauntlet will vote for CP059. There is a risk of subjectivity in reducing payouts to top addresses. Voting is now live. One account received a large portion of the payments and exploited a flaw in COMP rewards. They should not be rewarded further.
The November DAI price spike in Compound has sparked a debate on whether compensation should be given. The proposal to utilize reserves to protect users of the protocol has been praised for its technical implementation. Some argue that the allocation of reserves is inefficient and rewards farmers, but it is suggested that this event should be used to adjust COMP distribution and incentives going forward. a16z voted yes on the proposal, citing the protocol's divergence from user expectations and successful testing of the reimbursement mechanism. However, it is emphasized that this should not set a precedent for future user losses. The community agreed that users are not at fault for the liquidations. Some users feel that the compensation is minimal and does not cover their losses, particularly for Ethereum positions that were liquidated. It is acknowledged that the protocol cannot cover losses based on market changes, but users should have considered using another protocol.

Their goal is to enhance the developer experience and support Ethereum's public goods. The foundation is seeking $30 million in funding, with $15 million already secured from various sources. They plan to expand the Hardhat suite of tools and build long-term infrastructure to promote organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem. The foundation is also proposing a $5 million contribution from Compound Governance. Developer experience is crucial for the success of Ethereum, as it affects developer adoption, learning speed, and ecosystem innovation. The Nomic Foundation aims to alleviate the challenges of building Ethereum tooling and improve the overall developer experience. They have identified four strategic pillars, including Solidity, EVM tooling, local development environment, and Ethereum connector library, and plan to build platforms for each of these pillars. Their most important projects, Slang and Rethnet, will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools more efficiently.
The Nomic Foundation is developing several projects to benefit the Ethereum ecosystem, including Slang, Rethnet, Hardhat, and Web3.js. These projects aim to provide tools and infrastructure to developers, increase productivity, accelerate innovation, and grow the market for everyone. The Nomic Foundation is seeking funding from various organizations and individuals within the Ethereum community, including the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, and more. They are also requesting funding from the Compound DAO.
The Nomic foundation has requested funding from Compound, but the specific amount requested seems disproportionately large compared to the size of Compound's treasury. The community is discussing the funding request and some members are suggesting a lower funding level. The proposal has been revised from $5 million to $2 million based on community feedback. The proposal is not part of the existing grants program and there are questions about how it fits into Compound's budget and strategy.
The proposal for a $2 million donation to Nomic Labs is being questioned by some members of the community. They believe that the donation is excessive and does not provide enough direct benefit to the Compound Protocol. They compare it to the contributions made by other organizations, such as OpenZeppelin, who have committed to auditing the protocol and reviewing governance proposals. They also question the need for such a large donation, suggesting that it could be better allocated to other projects. Additionally, concerns are raised about the amount of funding being requested by Nomic Labs, which is $30 million in total. However, Nomic Labs defends their proposal, stating that the funding is necessary to build new software for the Ethereum ecosystem. They argue that without funding, important projects may not be able to happen. They also clarify that their tool, Hardhat, is more than just a simple tool and has significant functionality that benefits developers. They emphasize that they are dedicated to building infrastructure for the ecosystem and that the proposed funding is necessary for their plans.
Nomic Labs is proposing a plan that goes beyond just the Hardhat tool. They are working on projects like a new Solidity compiler called Slang and Rethnet, which will give birth to many more tools. They believe that their work will benefit Ethereum and Compound indirectly. They argue that supporting their work makes strategic sense for protocols like Compound that are aligned with the long-term growth of Ethereum. They believe that funding public goods, like the projects they are working on, will benefit the entire ecosystem, including Compound. They also emphasize the importance of decentralization and the need for funding to come from a diverse set of backers. They believe that an independent organization focused on helping Ethereum evolve is crucial for the success of protocols like Compound. They acknowledge that these efforts take time to build, but they believe that allocating resources now will lead to future results. They also highlight the importance of integrations and improving the developer experience to drive protocol activity. They appreciate the community's involvement in the discussion and look forward to further calibrating their proposal.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-should-compound-governance-contribute-funding-to-the-nomic-foundation/3032$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The current COMP Speed parameter allocates 0.1760 to suppliers and 0.1760 to borrowers. With the passage of Proposal 033, COMP Speeds are now set through governance. The community has the power to allocate COMP by market. The current allocation is a relic and will stay at the current rates until they are set through governance. There are several guiding questions to consider when modifying the allocation, such as whether the sum of COMP Speeds should match the current total and how important collateral markets should be allocated. The COMP Speeds can be used to increase distribution to more users and increase decentralization. At this time, the COMP Speed applies equally to suppliers and borrowers. It would require a significant protocol change to modify that relationship. The author suggests dynamically adjusting COMP speeds and conducting experiments to optimize COMP rewards and liquidity incentives.
Compound's data is transparent and public, allowing anyone to test it without spending money on data or compromising user privacy. However, producing and analyzing this data requires carefully designed experiments. Compound can lead the way in providing scientific rationale for parameter choices. It is suggested to optimize the COMP emission rate through experiments and reallocate some of the COMP to fund development work on the protocol. The current COMP distribution is expensive and distorts the market. Adjustments should be made to ensure the Net Borrow Rate is greater than the Net Supply Rate for each token. Decreasing the emission rate for the DAI market by 10% is proposed, along with using the proceeds from selling tokens for treasury reserves. The remaining emission can be redistributed to ETH and WBTC markets. The goal is to decentralize ownership of the protocol and attract new users while addressing market distortions. The decentralization process and its optimization should be discussed further.
The content discusses the distribution of COMP tokens in the protocol and suggests adjusting the velocity of COMP distributed in each market to incentivize users who are actually using the protocol. It also mentions the importance of distributing COMP to long-term stakeholders in the protocol rather than farmers. The content proposes a baseline set of allocations by market and suggests increasing the allocation to important collateral assets and COMP. It also includes a suggested distribution model that ""punishes"" frequent claiming of COMP. The Supply and Borrow numbers provided in the content are the market sizes at the time of the post.
The discussion is about the distribution of COMP tokens in the Compound protocol. The user suggests that yield farmers, who supply and borrow assets to generate positive cash flow from selling COMP tokens, do not bring much value to the protocol. They propose reducing COMP distributions to yield farmers and using the saved COMP for direct market selling or to seed reserves for pools. They also discuss the need for a clear and focused proposal on new COMP distribution. Another user agrees with the suggestion and mentions the importance of user participation in shaping a better model. They apologize for not providing specific calculations due to personal constraints. Another user mentions the opportunity cost for holding Ethereum on the protocol and suggests that a high loan-to-value ratio is not enough incentive due to volatility and liquidation risks.
The text suggests reducing the incentive to stablecoins on the deposit and lending side due to high interest rates. It also discusses the idea of grouping similar assets together. The author mentions the importance of risk management and insurance for the protocol, but notes that voting results on this proposal have been contrary to expectations. The text also highlights the high cost of liquidity incentives and compares user adoption rates between Compound and Aave. The author suggests that traditional marketing tricks are less effective in decentralized protocols. The text then delves into data analysis on recursive leverage and proposes changes to the existing COMP distributions, including reducing rewards for certain assets and potentially increasing COMP rewards. The author expresses concern about the centralized control of governance and the potential negative impact on membership growth and adoption.
The author proposes a minimum daily distribution for every market, regardless of utilization, to ensure fairness. They suggest a 10% minimum distribution spread evenly to every market. They argue against zeroing ZRX rewards and believe there should be a minimum for every market. They also discuss the rewards for the COMP market and suggest a lower number than what was proposed by Robert. They suggest a 75/25 distribution but acknowledge that it may not be possible to implement currently. They present two options for distribution adjustments, one involving cutting from stable coin distributions and the other involving decreasing WBTC and ETH distribution. They emphasize the importance of having a fixed part of distribution and discuss the percentages allocated to each market. They suggest that over 70% of daily emission going exclusively to stable coins may not be ideal. They mention the potential impact on borrowing in other markets and suggest that rates should be set dynamically. They express the need for academic research and a more decentralized economic model for decision-making. They also mention the need for better clarification on the vesting model. Finally, they propose an alternative allocation idea based on reward rates from lending and borrowing.
The borrow rates for collateral assets, including DAI and USDC, may become artificially high due to yield farming strategies. This could negatively impact regular users of lending protocols. However, recursive leverage on the same assets may not be profitable due to the inability to earn COMP rewards from both the deposit and borrow. Recursive leverage across different assets could still earn COMP on both sides but comes with higher risk. The mentioned changes to quantity and rates were implemented in Proposal 035 37.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-distribution-speeds/899$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound Labs is working on patches to improve gas efficiency and security in the Comptroller and CToken. The changes include allowing the liquidation of markets with a collateral factor of 0% and borrowing paused, optimizing the gas cost of claiming COMP, and modifying the seize function to transfer a portion of liquidation to cToken reserves. The community is invited to audit and provide feedback on the changes. A bug bounty has been launched, and a proposal will be made soon. There are discussions about the destination of funds from liquidations and the impact of reducing the liquidation incentive. The protocol's ability to recover and utilize reserves increases with each liquidation. There are suggestions for improving the Transfer and LiquidateBorrow events. The new contracts have been deployed, and Gauntlet will be voting in favor of the changes."$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/safety-and-gas-patches/1723$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Gauntlet has been working on designing a vesting mechanism for COMP that can be controlled by the community. They have looked at designs used in other protocols, such as Synthetix, and believe that a vesting mechanic is necessary to incentivize COMP for participation, liquidity, and improvements to the protocol's security and features. The liquidity provisioning use-case, which involves supplying cTokens to Uniswap, is particularly sensitive to the form of vesting used. Gauntlet proposes two extreme options for vesting: a fixed period for vesting that saves on gas but requires LPs to compute discount factors, and continuous vesting that is more expensive but simplifies the math for liquidity provisioning. They have provided pseudo-code implementations for these proposals and are seeking feedback. The discounting of the COMP portion of LP shares is necessary because COMP is more volatile than the assets producing it. The community should consider these proposals and whether there are other features or applications that need to be addressed.
The value of COMP in a Uniswap pool share depends on how often the cTokens in the pool vest COMP. Different vesting schedules require different levels of attention from COMP holders. The choice of vesting schedule can impact the value of COMP when used in other on-chain financial products. The main purposes of vesting are to incentivize development and security of the protocol and to incentivize long-term liquidity provisioning. Spending the entire budget of the protocol on liquidity provisioning is suboptimal, and there are other areas where the budget should be allocated. The current value of COMP is inflated due to speculation and limited supply. The issue of governance and price speculation not being compatible needs to be addressed. Vesting could have varying outcomes, such as farmers leaving or staying, or COMP becoming more scarce. The discussion of whether COMP should be a governance token or a speculative asset needs to be had. A vesting implementation has been proposed for COMP rewards, which encourages long-term holding and enables governance to issue COMP grants. The implementation also includes a reduced Comptroller size and an independent vesting module.
The user suggests adding vesting for COMP rewards to encourage long-term holding. However, they express concerns that this may drive users towards trading COMP derivatives instead. They propose a bonding curve to distribute COMP farmed on a 23-day basis. They also mention the need for refining the vesting structure and suggest quarterly vesting periods for simplicity in tax accounting. They emphasize the importance of security, decentralization, incentives for project development, and flexibility in the protocol.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/vesting-for-the-compound-protocol/252$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The proposal threshold for Compound's governance is currently 65K, allowing 12 addresses to make direct proposals. However, there are several issues that warrant revisiting this threshold. Current delegates are unable to create CAPs unless they own 100 COMP, limiting their participation in governance. Compound users also lack incentives to participate in governance, leading to a lack of ownership. To address these issues, the community is considering lowering the proposal threshold. Potential thresholds include 50K, 10K, 1K, and 100. A poll has been created to gather community input on the new minimum proposal threshold. If the community decides to reduce the threshold, a proposal will be put forward by Blockchain at Berkeley. The CAP threshold limit may also be reduced from 100 COMP to 1 COMP. The community is generally supportive of this initiative. The new GovernorBravoDelegate contract has been deployed, and a proposal to reduce the proposal threshold to 10K will be put forward. The PR for the updated contract, simulations, and ABIs has been opened.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$The proposal outlines the mechanics to compensate users for funds lost in the liquidation events of 11/26 by distributing 55,255 COMP (0.55% of total COMP supply) to affected users. The distribution will be done through a Merkle distributor contract. The amount of COMP needed for compensation is calculated based on the 14-day average closing price of COMP. The proposal aims to compensate users who lost funds and restore borrower confidence. It is considered achievable and a relatively small distribution. If supported, users can delegate COMP to the proposal. The proposal was made by a Compound user who was affected by the liquidation event.
The proposal aims to compensate users who were affected by the liquidations in the Compound protocol. The compensation percentage is based on the price of COMP tokens. The code for the proposal has already been developed and is currently live. The total compensation should be around 26% of the amount paid out by liquidators. Some community members are against the proposal, arguing that it sets a bad precedent and that the oracle/protocol should be changed before compensating users. However, others believe that both issues can be addressed separately. The proposal has been accepted and is part of a series of changes to reduce risk and improve the protocol. The design of oracles and liquidation mechanics will take time and require community feedback. Compensating users for market events is an important step in improving the protocol. Other protocols have also reimbursed users for similar events.
The discussion revolves around the compensation for users who were affected by a liquidation event on the Compound protocol. Some users believe that the current 8% compensation is too low and suggest a higher percentage, such as 15%. They argue that this is necessary to restore trust in the protocol and prevent competitors from gaining market share. Others question the rationale behind the 8% value and propose multiple compensation proposals. The technical details of the proposal involve using the Comptroller and Merkle Distributor to distribute COMP tokens to affected users. The discussion also touches on the importance of addressing the oracle problem and the need for a more detailed report on the attack. Overall, the community is divided on the issue of compensation, with some emphasizing the need for fairness and others expressing concerns about the long-term implications.
The proposal for compensation in the Compound protocol is being discussed. Some users believe that the current plan is unfair and does not adequately compensate those who suffered losses. They suggest an amendment that takes into account the magnitude of the losses and provides a higher percentage of compensation. Others argue that the proposal disproportionately benefits large farming operations and propose capping the compensation for these accounts. There are also concerns about the lack of a fix for the underlying issue and the need for a more precise calculation of compensation. The debate revolves around whether the protocol should provide reimbursement and how it should be implemented. Some suggest using the protocol's reserves as a ceiling for compensation, while others argue against giving governance tokens as financial compensation. The discussion highlights the need to separate the issues of reimbursement and compensation and explore alternative solutions.
The proposal to give 0.55% of the total governance token supply to users with detrimental on-chain behavior is seen as insane and giving power to short-sighted actors. Some users argue that COMP is already being used as a form of money and that not all affected users were behaving detrimentally. There is a discussion about the need to fix the bug before compensating users, and some users question the decision to use Coinbase as the only source for price feed. There are suggestions to revise the compensation percentage and consider using DAI reserves or a combination of COMP and DAI reserves. The compensation proposal is seen as separate from fixing the bug, and there is debate about whether compensation should be linked to bug fix. Some users support compensation to build borrower trust and improve communication around risks. Polychain has voted against the proposal, citing concerns about reimbursement before a clear path to fixing the issue and potential encouragement of systemic risk. They also suggest denominated reimbursement in the liquidated asset rather than COMP.
The community acknowledges that the current oracle system worked as designed but not as expected. They are voting against a specific proposal but remain open to potential reimbursement. They support improving oracle robustness, implementing insurance funds, and exploring alternative reimbursement methods. Pantera Capital is voting against a proposal to compensate users affected by DAI liquidations. They believe compensating users encourages looser risk-taking and undermines risk assessment in Compound markets. They suggest implementing protocol insurance funds, multi-oracle designs, and removing ""safe max"" language in Compound UI. They also mention the need for sustainable and healthy solutions for the protocol. There is a discussion about the behavior aligned with the long-term goals of the protocol and the bug in the Compound protocol or Coinbase open price feed. There are also comments about the manipulation of the protocol and the role of Coinbase in the DAI liquidation event.
There are potential risks in manipulating the market to obtain cheap Ethereum. The author didn't realize the risk of being robbed by the protocol's aggressive liquidation system. They also didn't know that using the borrowing function was not recommended. The author questions the need for DeFi and discusses the issue with the open oracle using only one price source. The discussion includes suggestions to harden the oracle system by using more price sources. The author also mentions the need for compensation for affected users and the importance of aligning COMP holders with depositors. There is a proposal to distribute COMP to offset losses incurred by liquidated DAI positions. Some entities point out the flaws in Compound's oracle design and suggest improvements. There is a call to summarize all compensation proposals and seek clarity on potential solutions before finalizing reimbursement.
The proposal for compensation in the COMP token was not accepted by the VC funds. The fairest calculation for compensation is suggested to be weighted compensation in DAI. Adding more reporters to the list, such as okex, could be a solution. However, simply adding more reporters may not provide adequate market coverage. There is a chance that modifying the proposal could lead to its acceptance. A spreadsheet has been created to analyze the liquidated accounts and their recursive factors. Out of 122 accounts, 87 have a recursive factor of 0 and only 29 have a recursive factor greater than 0.50. A possible compensation scheme based on the recursive factor has been computed, resulting in a total compensation of 2.22M. Further work, such as calculating liquidation prices and determining accounts that would have been liquidated due to price crashes, has been suggested.
The text discusses the need to calculate the prices of liquidations and determine if there are other accounts that may have been liquidated due to the DAI price. It also addresses disagreements with the categorization of users and the pseudomath used to support it. The author suggests fixing any issues with the protocol and allowing the big COMP holders to decide on compensation for affected users. They emphasize the importance of not dividing the users for the long-term health of the protocol.
The proposal suggests that the riskiness of each account should be taken into account when determining compensation for users affected by liquidation. However, the main focus should be on calculating the amount of money lost by users and how much can be returned to them. The suggestion is made to consider the accounts that would have been liquidated regardless of the DAI price manipulation. There is a disagreement about whether there is a difference between normal users and recursive farmers, with the argument that farmers are diluting COMP incentives for normal users. The value of the damage caused by the liquidation can be computed based on the liquidation transactions and should include the false liquidation and penalty. It is difficult to categorize users and track their collateral values because the liquidation was a result of DAI price manipulation. The relationship between protocol owners and users is compared to traditional finance and business. There is a discussion about the manipulation of DAI price and the adequacy of Coinbase as the sole price oracle. The argument is made that the protocol should not rely on unreliable price discovery sources. The spike in DAI price on Coinbase is questioned and the lack of arguments about the event is highlighted. The conclusion is that the situation is not normal market behavior and the protocol should not be made for liquidators. The community vote against compensation is attributed to it not fitting for VC funds.
The discussion revolves around the issue of compensating users who were affected by false liquidations on the Compound protocol. One user suggests that normal users should not be treated the same as those who intentionally exploited the system. Another user agrees but points out that the protocol relies on farming users for its market cap and TVL. The discussion also touches on the centralized nature of the Compound protocol and the lack of proof regarding price manipulation. A model is proposed to calculate the damages and determine the percentage of compensation. The discussion concludes with the need to decide on the distribution method and crafting a new proposal.
The content discusses the practice of stablecoin pair farming and its exploitation of the COMP distribution program. It also raises questions about the definition of ""yield farmer"" and the responsibility of COMP holders in cases of manipulation or error. The author argues that the current method of identifying recursive farmers is flawed and suggests alternative proposals for compensation. They also express dissatisfaction with the proposed compensation plan and suggest that it does not adequately cover the costs of liquidation.
The model categorizes users into two groups based on whether they would have been liquidated correctly or not. Damages for those who would not have been liquidated correctly include the extra collateral taken and the liquidation penalty. For those who would have been liquidated anyway, the damages are the difference in liquidation penalties. The discussion also touches on the need to address the oracle failure and the possibility of compensation for affected users. There are suggestions for calculating real losses and potential solutions for fixing the issue. The proposal for compensation is still being discussed and requires more clarity before finalizing any reimbursement.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/compensation-proposal-distribute-comp-to-affected-users-in-the-dai-liquidations/801$$;

The AVC Split and Minority Quorum element is described as a mechanism for structural adaptability within the AVC framework, allowing for the bifurcation of a single AVC into two distinct entities based on a specific threshold of verified MKR ownership. This mechanism ensures that any split is a substantial and considered decision by a significant minority of stakeholders. Both elements align with the broader principles and perspectives outlined in the Atlas, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and alignment with the MakerDAO's strategic vision.

The author also mentions concerns about the timing of the proposed changes and suggests further discussion on decreasing total COMP emissions.
Compound is considering making changes to the protocol to address the issue of recursive borrowing, which provides little value to the protocol. Farmers are leveraging their funds multiple times to earn COMP rewards, but this strategy is not seen as valuable to the protocol. Compound is proposing to increase the collateral factor (cf) for USDC and DAI markets, which would allow for higher leverage and farming rewards. However, to offset the increased rewards, COMP distribution would be lowered. This change would primarily benefit recursive farmers and potentially decrease rewards for non-recursive users. Compound is open to other proposals but is making changes that balance the interests of protocol users, COMP holders, and the community.
The content discusses proposed changes to the Compound protocol, specifically regarding collateral factors and distribution speeds of COMP tokens. One user argues for allocating a larger portion to other markets, while another user disagrees and believes the changes will only benefit certain users. Another user expresses concerns about the evidence provided to justify the collateral changes. The importance of separating and analyzing the impact of changes is emphasized. The risk and incentive parameters of the protocol are also discussed, with suggestions to improve the liquidation system and experiment with incentives. The content concludes with a proposed schedule for implementing the changes.

The Collateral Factor and Liquidation Incentive are the primary levers used to optimize capital efficiency and manage the overall Value at Risk (VaR) of the protocol. The reserve factor is now being added as a layer to reflect the second step of risk management, which is building sufficient reserves to absorb losses. Gauntlet recommends decreasing reserve factors for certain assets and decreasing all other reserve factors by 500 bps.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Last Wednesday's governance call discussed the management and distribution of the treasury's COMP tokens. The current reward system is not effectively attracting new users, as most of the COMP ends up being sold. Several ideas were proposed to address this issue, including rewarding voters with more votes, separating supply and borrow side COMP rewards, expanding the grants program, covering fees related to using Compound, and distributing additional COMP rewards to users who participate in governance. These ideas would likely be done off-chain and could be implemented through a script that analyzes activity. Delegated COMP votes would count for the voter, not the delegator. The goal is to align incentives with user engagement rather than just capital.
The author expresses support for several ideas to incentivize users in the Compound protocol. They support the idea of splitting borrow/supply streams for COMP rewards, expanding the Grants program, and providing partial reimbursement of costs to interact with the protocol. However, they are opposed to the idea of rewarding users based on the amount of capital they hold. They also suggest enabling free voting through Coinbase wallet, cheap withdrawal/transfer of COMP, and shifting COMP rewards to the supply side. The author emphasizes the importance of incentivizing participation in governance, attracting new users, maximizing protocol revenue, and supporting and expanding the protocol, particularly V3 and Gateway. They believe that the grant program can play a significant role in supporting projects related to borrowing. The author also mentions the need to establish a balance between giving away COMP and running the protocol as a business.
The author suggests implementing a slp/LP/BLP COMP/ETH token as collateral to align incentives. They also propose cutting 100% of COMP distribution and giving it to the community instead of Yearn. The author shares some dashboards they made and expresses support for the Kyber pool governance model. They discuss the idea of rewarding early users and express concern about airdropped users dumping tokens. They suggest vesting the tokens and giving early users an early credit for governance participation. The author also mentions being against burning COMP and doing an airdrop. They discuss different ideas for distributing COMP rewards and suggest turning Compound into a self-sustaining protocol. They propose supersizing the grants department and incentivizing delegates for governance work. The author also mentions gas fee reimbursements and gas improvements. They discuss the issue of voter participation and the concentration of voting power. They argue that the design of the COMP token is flawed and suggest using it as collateral or for LP at AMM DEXes.
The content discusses the need to improve the distribution of COMP tokens and address the issues with the current COMP market. It suggests creating a Compound market for LP tokens and finding a technical solution for LP voting power. It also mentions the idea of airdrops to improve distribution. The content addresses the possibility of rewarding voters but highlights the need to solve the problems of Sybil attacks and whales draining the treasury. It suggests a scaling reward system and discusses the potential limitations and challenges. The content also mentions the optimization of COMP distribution and proposes separating compSpeed into separate supply and borrow incentives. It suggests modifying COMP distribution to put more tokens into the hands of users and expanding the grants team. Additionally, it mentions increasing the reserves of the protocol as an alternative to providing COMP to farming users.
The content discusses various ideas for improving the Compound protocol and increasing the distribution of COMP tokens. Some of the ideas include rewarding voters, separating supply and borrow rewards, expanding the grants program, implementing a transaction fee reimbursement program, and providing extra COMP rewards to protocol users who vote. The content also mentions the possibility of a referral program, institutional business development schemes, token swaps with other protocols, and a ""governance mining"" program to reward valuable governance participation.
The discussion revolves around different strategies for incentivizing users in Compound's governance. One suggestion is to reward users with COMP tokens for their on-chain activity that increases protocol reserves. Another idea is to create a program to cover fees associated with using Compound. There is also a proposal to distribute additional COMP rewards to users who participate in governance. Some users argue for an airdrop to early users as a way to incentivize and acknowledge their contributions to the protocol. However, there are opposing views on this idea among the largest COMP holders. The importance of incentivizing real users and community-building is emphasized. Overall, the goal is to find effective ways to engage users in governance and promote the growth of the protocol.
The author had a positive experience using Compound, earning money by borrowing and selling ETH. They also spent time on the forum but found it not worth it.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Reserve Protocol is proposing the deployment of an ecosystem stablecoin called compUSD to the Compound community. This stablecoin would provide increased safety mechanisms and generate revenue for the Compound DAO. The compUSD stablecoin would be backed by diverse assets and would offer capital preservation and safety through overcollateralization. It would also incentivize liquidity providers and use the generated yield to provide affordable loans within the Compound ecosystem. The proposed initial asset basket for compUSD includes aUSDT, fUSDC, and sDAI. The revenue generated by compUSD would be shared with stakeholders, with a portion allocated to RSR stakers for governance and overcollateralization, and the remaining portion directed to Compound's treasury for incentives.
The compUSD lending market in the Compound protocol generates revenue that can be used for incentives. The revenue can be converted into COMP or distributed as compUSD, aligning with the lending market's currency. This approach can drive network effects for the new Compound v3 lending market. compUSD has umbrella overcollateralization provided by RSR token holders, which serves as a safeguard in case of collateral default. Minting and redeeming compUSD can be done by market makers, yield farmers, and arbitrageurs. The Reserve protocol operates autonomously and is governed by a decentralized community of RSR stakers, ensuring censorship resistance. Liquidity incentives are important for bootstrapping liquidity in the compUSD market. Reserve Protocol has made a $20m investment in Convex Finance, Curve Finance, and Stake DAO to incentivize deeper liquidity.
Compound is considering launching its own stablecoin, compUSD, and is seeking feedback from the community. compUSD would act as a complexity wrapper to reduce market fragmentation and offer increased safety through diverse asset-backing. It would also provide liquidity incentives for liquidity providers and enable affordable loans within the Compound ecosystem. The adoption of compUSD could extend beyond the crypto-native community and potentially include savings, remittance, and payment use cases. The Reserve Protocol has undergone multiple security audits and bug bounties to ensure the platform's safety. The development approach for compUSD includes three phases: Explore, Deploy, and Bootstrap Supply. The community's feedback and support will determine the future of compUSD.
Compound has aligned with USDC on purpose, as it is a conservative DeFi protocol. Torque 11 is building on Comet to supercharge growth. Maker has Spark Protocol as a sub-DAO. Torque is an unofficial Compound sub-DAO. The proposed CompUSD uses Compound's competitors as backing strategies. The governance of the new token would be RSR holders, not COMP holders. The proposal suggests redirecting most of the yield from the underlying tokens to compUSD holders. It also proposes diversifying the collateral basket to mitigate risks. compUSD should tap into the yield earned by collateral in Compound v2. Other stablecoin collateralization options are OUSD and eUSD. The proposal has pros such as diversified asset backing, revenue generation, and decentralized governance.
The proposal presents a complex approach to creating a stablecoin backed by diversified assets, with a focus on decentralized governance and liquidity incentives. However, there are several challenges such as complexity, gas fees, dependency on liquidity providers, and regulatory considerations. To improve the proposal, suggestions include simplifying the language, providing technical specifications, conducting a risk assessment, addressing gas fee concerns, detailing a market adoption strategy, explaining the governance process, outlining developer contributions, emphasizing testing and auditing, expanding real-world use cases, seeking community feedback, and developing an implementation roadmap. Visual aids can also help explain key concepts.
When users mint and redeem compUSD, they have the choice to redeem to 100% of the available collateral of their choice via ""zap"" or redeem the compUSD Rtoken in its exact basket proportions of collateral. Minting Rtokens via Zaps is currently live on Register.app. Redeeming via Zaps is coming soon. The yield referred to in the quoted excerpt is the holder yield of an RToken just for any user holding it, in any wallet, which does not require any lending market, DEX or other instrument. RTokens are bearer instruments and when they have holder yield, the user does not need to take any action other than hold in order to accrue the yield. In the specific case of compUSD we are proposing a 0% holder yield since this yield would increase the cost of borrowing the asset. One might wonder, why would anyone mint compUSD? We think DeFi yield farmers and market makers would mint compUSD on the Reserve protocol, then either supply compUSD to the Compound v3 market to earn yield, or LP compUSD on the Curve DEX to earn yield. The yields in either case could be materially better than just holding the underlying collateral. A sufficiently liquid compUSD market would also serve as a venue for interest rate arbitrage relative to Compound's USDC market, so borrowing demand would generate yield, and thus incentive to mint compUSD. A separate governance token like RSR for the Compound Dollar would bring several advantages for Compound, including stability and independence, clear governance focus, encouraging engagement, smoother regulatory adaptations, and opportunities for integration with other protocols.
The liquidation mechanisms in the event of a collateral value drop involve initiating an auction to sell defaulted collateral and seizing RSR from the staking pool. The ""complexity wrapper"" section refers to how compUSD functions as an ERC20 token while powering a growth flywheel with security features. The ""COMP emissions allocation"" in the bootstrapping section suggests using revenue generated by compUSD to buy and distribute COMP as incentives for borrowing in the v3 market. The discussion also touches on the potential for multiple stablecoins to coexist and the conservative nature of Compound's ecosystem.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-feedback-request-compusd-a-safer-revenue-generating-stablecoin/4627$$;

The author discusses the challenges of tracking user interactions and suggests a capital-weighted distribution model. They provide plots comparing different distribution scenarios and ask for feedback.
The content discusses the distribution of COMP tokens to early users of the Compound protocol. It raises questions about the purpose of the distribution, the amount of COMP to be distributed, the vesting schedule, and the eligibility criteria for users.

The author also mentions the Compound Grants program as a tool to support the distribution. There is a debate about the cutoff date for eligibility and suggestions for handling different types of users. The discussion also includes suggestions for the distribution model, including capping rewards per address and using a $50 interest cutoff. The user is analyzing early user interactions with the Compound protocol and provides a progress report on their analysis. They mention the availability of their code for public review and request feedback from developers.
The community is discussing the distribution of COMP tokens to early users of the Compound protocol. They are considering different distribution models based on factors such as interest earned and time contributed. There is a suggestion to use a time-weighted vesting schedule, but there are challenges with implementing it. A constant vesting rate for every address may be a simpler solution. A spreadsheet has been created to simulate different airdrop scenarios. The distribution model for COMP rewards has been adjusted to be more fair and balanced. The rewards now start at 5 COMP for 0.01 interest earned and increase as the interest earned approaches a certain threshold. The community is also discussing ways to address the imbalance in token distribution and empower active users. There is ongoing discussion about the size of the distribution and the opportunity cost of distributing COMP. Some users argue against an airdrop, while others believe it is necessary for decentralized governance. The decision ultimately lies with the founders, team, and early investors who control the majority of COMP voting power. The effectiveness of using airdrops to promote governance is debated, and some users suggest allowing users to claim the COMP distribution through their wallets.

This would create reserves for the protocol and provide stability for suppliers. There is also a suggestion to enable COMP holders to contribute to reserve pools. Overall, the idea is to minimize reserve rates while still ensuring the growth and stability of the protocol.

Compound is proposing a rewards decay schedule to address the COMP farming issue. The proposal suggests gradually reducing rewards to an equilibrium where profits are maximized. The decay schedule includes a 6% decay rate every 28 days for stablecoin rewards and a 1% decay rate every 28 days for non-stablecoin rewards. The goal is to discourage farming behavior and ensure long-term success for the protocol. The success metric for this proposal is gross profit. The action plan includes normalizing rewards rates and rebalancing them as global and local markets change. After 10 years, approximately 1,755,000 COMP will be distributed through this rewards program. There will be about 590,000 COMP remaining for other rewards programs and work contracts.

Initially, all cToken contracts were immutable, but later-generation contracts became upgradable. The upgradable contracts have advantages such as the ability to sweep assets into other protocols, vote governance tokens, recover orphaned funds, and support future features. The community may consider migrating cTokens, which would involve creating a new market for the asset and incentivizing users to migrate. The downside of this approach includes separate interest rates, potential confusion, and ecosystem chores. The migration process would require deploying a new contract, updating price feed proxies, creating a governance proposal, and eventually deprecating the old market. Migrating assets can be cumbersome, and considerations such as updating interfaces and tooling need to be taken into account. The community has discussed various ideas and concerns related to the migration process."$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/managing-ctoken-versions/1220$$;
UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$Compound Governance has proposed a new idea to support the growth of the PoolTogether protocol. Instead of using COMP tokens, the proposal suggests that the Compound protocol ""sponsor"" the USDC prize savings pool on PoolTogether with $10 million of USDC. This sponsorship would contribute interest to the savings prizes but would not be eligible to win. The proposal outlines the execution steps, including sending COMP to the Timelock, minting cCOMP with COMP, borrowing $10 million USDC using cCOMP as collateral, and depositing the USDC into the sponsorship of the USDC savings pool.

The risks associated with this proposal are low, as the PoolTogether contracts have been live on the mainnet since January 2021 with no exploits. The only additional risk is the potential liquidation of the loan if the COMP price significantly decreases, but this can be managed by setting a low liquidation price.

The benefits of this proposal include incentivizing growth through integration partners at a low cost and low risk. The $10 million USDC would be redeposited back into Compound, benefiting both protocols. This approach could serve as a template for supporting other applications or use cases with liquidity.

There are some questions and considerations raised, such as the cost to COMP token-holders in terms of USDC interest paid to the protocol and the impact on the cCOMP and USDC markets. The timeline for returning the sponsorship USDC to the protocol is flexible, and Compound governance would have complete control over the funds. There is no need for an agreement between the protocols, and there is no recourse if the USDC is not returned.

Alternative options from Compound's perspective include selling COMP for USDC or withdrawing USDC reserves to sponsor PoolTogether. However, withdrawing reserves may not be the best option, and selling COMP would require further discussion. The proposal suggests exploring the idea of a ""Compound Liquidity"" fund to deploy across multiple protocols.

Overall, the proposal is seen as a creative approach to supporting PoolTogether and has received support from the community. It will be further discussed in a developer call, and next steps will be determined.$$ WHERE dp.url = $$https://www.comp.xyz/t/supporting-the-compound-ecosystem/1638$$;

There are various risks associated with stETH, including smart contract security, ETH 2.0 technical and adoption risks, DAO key management risk, slashing risk, and stETH price risk. Lido provides insurance coverage for slashing risk. The proposed risk parameters for stETH on Compound are a loan-to-value ratio of 10% and a reserve factor of 15%. The price of stETH can be determined by pegging it to ETH at a 1:1 ratio, using ChainLink's price feed, or taking the price from Curve. The community is discussing the potential impact of users borrowing ETH, converting it to stETH, and depositing it back into Compound. The main concern is the potential for the stETH discount to increase if too many people engage in this trade. The community is encouraged to join the discussion at the upcoming community call.
The GBTC premium collapsed and even went negative, causing funds to take a big loss and default on their BTC loans. Compound sees an opportunity to make cETH more productive with stable borrowing demand. The deployment of stETH is discussed, including the interest rate model and implementation. Lido proposes adding stETH to Compound, but the plan for Compound v2 integration has been abandoned due to liquidity and reporter issues. The process for adding stETH to Compound v3 is outlined, including the need for reporters to run the custom feed and Chainlink's involvement. The optimal number of reporters and the frequency of price feed updates are discussed.
The e stETH/USD feed updates at least once an hour or when the price moves by 1%. It is suggested to create a cheaper wstETH-stETH feed instead of a wstETH-USD feed. Adding stETH as collateral in Compound V3 could increase ETH borrows and reserves. The cost of custom feeds for stETH should be outweighed by the incremental reserve growth. Option 2, with optimized borrow rates, could result in significant reserve growth. However, it may also bring greater risks.

Gauntlet's simulations take into account various factors such as user positions, asset volatility, and trading volume to optimize the parameter recommendations. The proposal also includes charts and tables to provide further context. Morpho Labs has raised concerns about the proposal, stating that it could reduce the relevance and competitiveness of the Compound protocol. They suggest an alternative solution of integrating a liquidity dimension to the interest rates curve to address the concerns. They also propose changing the current interest rate model as a short-term solution.
DefiEdge 5 is an asset management protocol built on Uniswap v3. The proposal to set borrow caps on Compound has sparked a debate among community members. Some argue that borrow caps can protect the protocol from various risks, such as insolvency and price manipulation. Others, like Morpho Labs, believe that this proposal could reduce the relevance of the protocol and raise new risks. They suggest exploring alternative solutions, such as integrating a liquidity dimension to the interest rate curve. The community is divided on the issue, with concerns about the impact on borrowing volume and the need for more data and discussion.
Proposal 135 11 implements borrowing caps on collateral assets to limit risk in Compound v2. Stablecoin assets are not affected by the caps. The introduction of these caps may lead to the deactivation of the peer-to-peer matching engine of Morpho-Compound. One suggestion to address concerns is to integrate a liquidity dimension to the interest rates curve, where the borrow rate spikes when the total borrow volume reaches a set parameter. This short-term solution can be adjusted if needed. The proposal passed, but there was a healthy debate about the utility constraints of the protocol. Morpho Labs believes that risk and utility should be considered in Compound proposals. The notion of ""governance rights"" as a reason for token value is criticized by Vitalik Buterin. The proposed changes are seen as sensible and should reduce risk in Compound v2. It may be necessary to periodically update the borrow cap parameters based on organic borrowing demand.

Gauntlet provides an example of the impact of a previous parameter change and identifies areas for optimization. They also support reserve factor parameterization and will communicate risk parameter updates through forums and community calls. Gauntlet will build a Risk Dashboard and API to provide insights into risk and capital efficiency. They charge a service fee based on the value they add to protocols.
Gauntlet is proposing a risk management system for Compound that includes optimizing metrics such as risk-adjusted yield and capital efficiency. They plan to track these metrics through a risk dashboard and will update it over time based on user feedback. They also address the recent changes to liquidation mechanics and how it will be incorporated into their simulation models. Gauntlet aims to set an acceptable VaR relative to reserves by standardizing it across all assets and involving the community in the decision-making process. The proposed fees will be evaluated regularly and community members are encouraged to provide input. Gauntlet plans to hold COMP tokens and self-delegate for governance votes, but may need to sell tokens in the future for operational expenses. Overall, this proposal is seen as a positive step for Compound and Gauntlet, as it emphasizes the importance of community involvement in maintaining and improving the protocol.
Gauntlet is being paid a significant amount of money for their risk analysis and parameter recommendation services for Compound. They have demonstrated good intent, but the payment is still a large sum for an uncertain return. Gauntlet is expected to deliver on certain points to secure a second quarter of payment. They will support new markets that are added, have experience in recommending borrow caps and reserve factors, and have a point person for community questions. They also have a Value at Risk statistic that combines liquidation loss and insolvency metrics. They use historical price and liquidity data for market analysis. Gauntlet currently has no plans to open-source their risk models and simulation SDK. The proposed payment amount is questioned by some community members, who suggest using it for safety reserves instead. The protocol will pay Gauntlet with COMP, but there are concerns about the availability of COMP and the responsibility of Gauntlet if their proposed changes do not protect the protocol. The risk models underlying key protocol variables are proprietary, but there is no third party that reviews them. The proposed fee for Gauntlet is considered high, and some suggest paying vendors in stable currencies like USDC or DAI to decrease dilution for tokenholders.
It is suggested to establish a small group of experts, such as a ""Risk Committee"" or ""Vendor Due Diligence Group,"" to review technical proposals on behalf of tokenholders. This would ensure that proposals like Gauntlet's are evaluated more effectively. It is also proposed to implement a bidding process for vendors to compete for work, similar to how companies make large purchases. Paying vendors in COMP aligns with the governance token's role, but it is important for the protocol to make sound financial decisions for itself. It is recommended to have an open-source non-proprietary risk model for Compound and to incorporate various types of risks into the analysis and dashboard.
The community suggests that Gauntlet's service fee is too expensive from a protocol perspective. They recommend clarifying and structuring the proposal better by specifying inputs, outputs, and objectives of the risk simulation. The objective is to enhance capital efficiency while controlling risk, measured by Borrow Usage and Value-At-Risk (VAR). Gauntlet will provide recommended values for VAR and Borrow Usage through simulations using protocol risk parameters and market statistics as inputs. The simulations will also generate outputs such as net insolvent debt, collateral liquidated, users liquidated, and system collateralization ratio. In the longer term, Gauntlet aims to optimize risk-adjusted yield for depositors and capital efficiency for borrowers. The community also suggests incorporating regulatory risk, governance risk, smart contract risk, and other types of risks into Gauntlet's analysis and dashboard.

UPDATE discourse_posts dp SET dp.ai_summary = $$A proposal has been made to adjust the liquidation factors for two Compound V3 assets. The current values and recommended values are as follows:

- COMP Liquidation Factor: 88% (current) -> 83% (recommended)
- WBTC Liquidation Factor: 95% (current) -> 93% (recommended)

These updates aim to improve the solvency of the Compound protocol during extreme market conditions. By decreasing the liquidation factors, the incentive for liquidators to remove collateral from the protocol increases. Gauntlet's simulation engine has analyzed market and liquidity data to inform these parameter recommendations.

Based on Gauntlet's simulations, reducing the COMP liquidation factor from 88% to 83% decreases the Value at Risk (VaR) for COMP from $5.5m to $5m, a 9% reduction. Similarly, decreasing the WBTC liquidation factor from 95% to 93% reduces its VaR from $5.9m to $4.9m, a 17% reduction. These parameter changes are proposed as a preventive measure against potential disastrous market events.

It is important to note that these changes to the liquidation factors do not significantly impact capital efficiency. The proposal also considers the trade-off between user experience and protocol risk. While borrowers prefer lower liquidation factors, risk managers aim for higher factors to incentivize liquidators and provide a reserve cushion for the protocol.

The proposal welcomes community feedback and plans to go on-chain on 1/2/23 or as soon as any blocking feedback is addressed. It is important to consider the risks of insolvency and the liquidity conditions during stress periods when evaluating the impact of these parameter changes.

There is an alternative option to reduce the StoreFrontPriceFactor (SFPF) instead of increasing the liquidation penalty. However, this may negatively affect the protocol's reserve growth over time. The community's input and strategic considerations are crucial in determining the best approach.

The current solution is not ideal and there is uncertainty about the next steps to improve it. Suggestions have been made to add Chainlink as an oracle provider, use Makerdao's oracle, or incorporate additional exchanges and decentralized exchanges as price feeds. The proposal is to build a medianizer that can handle multiple price feeds, starting with Coinbase Pro, Okex, and Uniswap. The medianizer should consider the freshness of prices and allow for the addition of more feeds in the future. The community is encouraged to contribute to this improvement, and a grant of 1000 COMP is suggested for successful implementation. There are discussions about modifying the Open Price Feed or using Chainlink as part of the medianizer. Some community members prefer the medianizer approach, while others suggest using Chainlink as a proven solution. The community is also encouraged to decide on trustworthy on-chain sources and correlation factors.
The discussion revolves around the use of Chainlink as an oracle solution and the need for multiple sources of oracles to avoid single points of failure. Some argue that Chainlink is susceptible to human error and that adding more price feeds to the open oracle would be a better solution. Others believe that Chainlink provides a comprehensive and immediate solution that doesn't require extensive development. The proposal to implement a medianizer and include multiple sources of oracles is seen as a necessary step to address the oracle issue. The Band Protocol team has expressed interest in developing this solution. Concerns are raised about the delay in Coinbase's oracle API and the potential for unfair advantages in liquidations. It is suggested that relying on off-chain sources could bring centralized finance (CeFi) tactics to decentralized finance (DeFi). The goal is to build a robust price feed system with multiple sources to prevent manipulation.
The discussion is about the development of a medianizer for price feeds in the Compound community. There are concerns about data quality and transparency in centralized exchanges and the potential impact on decentralized finance (DeFi). The idea of governance is brought up, questioning who has control over the majority of votes and whether decisions are made for political reasons. The need for a functional websocket service and built-in delays between price updates and liquidation is mentioned. The importance of considering market coverage and data quality in selecting data sources for the medianizer is highlighted. The community consensus is mentioned, but there are concerns about the lack of discussion and the potential risks of mixing lower quality raw data with higher quality refined data. Gas efficiency and the possibility of an intermediary contract to collect prices from various sources are also discussed.
The suggestion is to modify the Open Price Feed to either have a separate contract for the medianizer or to have the medianizer built-in. The medianizer would allow for the consideration of adding more price feeds to the protocol. However, there are concerns about the medianizer weighing each input equally, which could increase the risk of data manipulation attacks. It is important to only add high-quality sources for price data and to avoid overweighing certain exchanges or price feed solutions. The goal is to improve the current system and use resources efficiently.
The current issue with the Compound protocol is that it relies on a medianizer that weighs each input equally, which can lead to manipulation and inaccurate price data. Adding more exchanges to the medianizer may provide more market coverage initially, but there is no guarantee it will stay that way in the future. The concern is not just about downtime, but also about data manipulation attacks. The solution is to use a properly weighted average price feed that takes into account the quality and liquidity of each exchange. This would provide more accurate and tamper-resistant market coverage. It is suggested to consider using price feed solutions like Chainlink, which have proven their ability to generate and maintain market coverage for other money markets.
The proposal is to create a new oracle medianizer that allows multiple prices from multiple reporters to be submitted in one transaction. Governance would have the ability to add more reporters and adjust their weights. The medianizer would use a weighted median as the asset price for Comptroller calculation. On-chain price data can also be used as a reporter. The exact source of the price data is considered irrelevant to the implementation. The goal is to prevent liquidation by ensuring that prices are within a certain threshold. Some members express concerns about compromising on data quality, while others see this as a necessary step for the protocol. The Band Protocol team presents a proof of concept for the medianizer and plans to make it into an efficient contract ready for audit. They also plan to analyze gas costs, make the contract upgradable, and research integrating other oracles.
