To create separate environments for staging and production, you can create separate 
Terraform workspaces and update your Terraform configuration to use environment-specific 
settings based on the current workspace.


With this configuration, you can create separate environments for staging and 
production using Terraform workspaces. Initialize the Terraform configuration and 
create the workspaces:
```shell
terraform init
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
```
To deploy the staging environment, switch to the staging workspace, and apply the 
configuration:

```shell
terraform workspace select staging
terraform apply
```


To deploy the production environment, switch to the production workspace, and apply the configuration:

```shell
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply
```
This way, you can manage separate environments for your application using Terraform 
workspaces. Make sure to replace the subnet IDs and security group IDs in the main.tf 
with the appropriate values from your AWS account.

In summary, you have Terraform configurations that create an ECS cluster, task 
definition, and service for your application, with different settings for staging and production environments. The code also takes care of environment variables, both secrets and configs, and sets up IAM roles and policies for the ECS tasks.


To set environment variables in your Terraform configuration, we use the .tfvars option

We Create a terraform.tfvars file in your project's root directory and set the values for 
the required variables:

```Makefile
jwt_private_key = "your_jwt_private_key"
all_guide_submissions_webhook = "your_all_guide_submissions_webhook"
server_errors_webhook = "your_server_errors_webhook"
public_aws_s3_bucket = "your_public_aws_s3_bucket"
discord_client_id = "your_discord_client_id"
discord_client_secret = "your_discord_client_secret"
discord_bot_token = "your_discord_bot_token"
all_guides_git_repository = "your_all_guides_git_repository"
```

Terraform will automatically load this file when you run terraform apply, terraform plan, 
or terraform init. Make sure not to commit sensitive information to your version control 
system.
